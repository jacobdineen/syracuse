'plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . \nthey get into an accident . \none of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . \nwhat\'s the deal ? \nwatch the movie and \" sorta \" find out . . . \ncritique : a mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . \nwhich is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just didn\'t snag this one correctly . \nthey seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . \nso what are the problems with the movie ? \nwell , its main problem is that it\'s simply too jumbled . \nit starts off \" normal \" but then downshifts into this \" fantasy \" world in which you , as an audience member , have no idea what\'s going on . \nthere are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained . \nnow i personally don\'t mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film\'s biggest problem . \nit\'s obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes . \nand do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? \nnot really . \nthe sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn\'t the make the film all that more entertaining . \ni guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is \" into it \" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . \ni mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ! \nokay , we get it . . . there \nare people chasing her and we don\'t know who they are . \ndo we really need to see it over and over again ? \nhow about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? \napparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows . \nthere might\'ve been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess \" the suits \" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . \nthe actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood . \nbut my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character\'s unraveling . \noverall , the film doesn\'t stick because it doesn\'t entertain , it\'s confusing , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . \noh , and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . . it\'s \njust packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids . \nit also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since . \nwhatever . . . skip \nit ! \nwhere\'s joblo coming from ? \na nightmare of elm street 3 ( 7/10 ) - blair witch 2 ( 7/10 ) - the crow ( 9/10 ) - the crow : salvation ( 4/10 ) - lost highway ( 10/10 ) - memento ( 10/10 ) - the others ( 9/10 ) - stir of echoes ( 8/10 ) \n',neg
'the happy bastard\'s quick movie review \ndamn that y2k bug . \nit\'s got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . \nlittle do they know the power within . . . \ngoing for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virus still feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance . \nwe don\'t know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we don\'t know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we don\'t know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout . \nhere , it\'s just \" hey , let\'s chase these people around with some robots \" . \nthe acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis . \nyou\'re more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 . \nsutherland is wasted and baldwin , well , he\'s acting like a baldwin , of course . \nthe real star here are stan winston\'s robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone\'s brain . \nso , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here\'s your movie . \notherwise , it\'s pretty much a sunken ship of a movie . \n',neg
'it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch . \nbased on the late 1960\'s television show by the same name , the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover . \nhowever , things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion . \nof course , the ads make it seem like so much more . \nquick cuts , cool music , claire dane\'s nice hair and cute outfits , car chases , stuff blowing up , and the like . \nsounds like a cool movie , does it not ? \nafter the first fifteen minutes , it quickly becomes apparent that it is not . \nthe mod squad is certainly a slick looking production , complete with nice hair and costumes , but that simply isn\'t enough . \nthe film is best described as a cross between an hour-long cop show and a music video , both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half . \nand with it comes every single clich ? . \nit doesn\'t really matter that the film is based on a television show , as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we\'ve already seen . \nthe characters and acting is nothing spectacular , sometimes even bordering on wooden . \nclaire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored , which really transfers onto the audience . \nthe only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi , who plays the resident crazy man , ultimately being the only thing worth watching . \nunfortunately , even he\'s not enough to save this convoluted mess , as all the characters don\'t do much apart from occupying screen time . \nwith the young cast , cool clothes , nice hair , and hip soundtrack , it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset . \ndespite an american \'r\' rating ( which the content does not justify ) , the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset . \ninformation on the characters is literally spoon-fed to the audience ( would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us ? ) , dialogue is poorly written , and the plot is extremely predictable . \nthe way the film progresses , you likely won\'t even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy , because you\'ll know they aren\'t . \nbasing the show on a 1960\'s television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom , especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand ( even one that\'s missing a finger or two ) . \nthe number of times that i checked my watch ( six ) is a clear indication that this film is not one of them . \nit is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar , judging from the rash of really awful teen-flicks that we\'ve been seeing as of late . \navoid this film at all costs . \n',neg
' \" quest for camelot \" is warner bros . \' first feature-length , fully-animated attempt to steal clout from disney\'s cartoon empire , but the mouse has no reason to be worried . \nthe only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall\'s promising , if flawed , 20th century fox production \" anastasia , \" but disney\'s \" hercules , \" with its lively cast and colorful palate , had her beat hands-down when it came time to crown 1997\'s best piece of animation . \nthis year , it\'s no contest , as \" quest for camelot \" is pretty much dead on arrival . \neven the magic kingdom at its most mediocre -- that\'d be \" pocahontas \" for those of you keeping score -- isn\'t nearly as dull as this . \nthe story revolves around the adventures of free-spirited kayley ( voiced by jessalyn gilsig ) , the early-teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur\'s round table . \nkayley\'s only dream is to follow in her father\'s footsteps , and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber ( gary oldman ) , an ex-round table member-gone-bad , steals arthur\'s magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous , booby-trapped forest . \nwith the help of hunky , blind timberland-dweller garrett ( carey elwes ) and a two-headed dragon ( eric idle and don rickles ) that\'s always arguing with itself , kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur\'s side . \n \" quest for camelot \" is missing pure showmanship , an essential element if it\'s ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney . \nthere\'s nothing here that differentiates \" quest \" from something you\'d see on any given saturday morning cartoon -- subpar animation , instantly forgettable songs , poorly-integrated computerized footage . \n ( compare kayley and garrett\'s run-in with the angry ogre to herc\'s battle with the hydra . \ni rest my case . ) \neven the characters stink -- none of them are remotely interesting , so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out-bland the others . \nin the end , it\'s a tie -- they all win . \nthat dragon\'s comedy shtick is awfully cloying , but at least it shows signs of a pulse . \nat least fans of the early-\'90s tgif television line-up will be thrilled to find jaleel \" urkel \" white and bronson \" balki \" pinchot sharing the same footage . \na few scenes are nicely realized ( though i\'m at a loss to recall enough to be specific ) , and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic ( though most are paired up with singers who don\'t sound a thing like them for their big musical moments -- jane seymour and celine dion ? ? ? ) . \nbut one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good . \naside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults , \" quest for camelot \" \'s most grievous error is its complete lack of personality . \nand personality , we learn from this mess , goes a very long way . \n',neg
'synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy\'s mother , a fledgling restauranteur . \nunsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman\'s favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way . \ncomments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video . \ntheir proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they\'re typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . \nstalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he\'s rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) . \nother than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . \nstalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . \ninterspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it\'s implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . \nafter these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears . \nthe narrator states that \" this is the story of daryl gleason \" and tells the audience that he is the stalker . \nof course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels . \nif the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked . \nokay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required . \nstalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious . \nthe opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together . \ndaryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her . \nultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate . \nthese plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet . \nfor some reason , this genre\'s films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked . \nstalked is no exception ( it\'s a cat this time -- found in the shower ) . \nevents like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you\'ll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) . \nstalked\'s cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either . \njay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much . \nhe overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands . \nmaryam d\'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the \" stalked \" of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner . \nbrooke ( d\'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed . \ntoward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl . \nto ensure he won\'t use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house . \ndoes she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ? \nof course not . \nshe tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house . \nwhen daryl returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger . \nsomehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , daryl is oblivious to her presence inside . \nthe whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience\'s suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character\'s intelligence . \nstalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched . \nrated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are . \nif you\'re in the mood for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else . \n',neg
'capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace . \nthere is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise . \njohn carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films , especially assault on precinct 13 , that the new film comes off as his homage to himself . \n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) . \njohn carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes . \nfor a writer and director of horror films , supposedly an expert on horror , it is a very bad mistake to make . \nghosts of mars is called a horror movie , but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace . \nin addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars , carpenter would have grounds to sue . \nthis film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 , the thing , and prince of darkness . \nit is , in fact , surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way . \nbut that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience . \nghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 . \nmars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film\'s budget ) . \nit is never mentioned , but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth-normal , again making it easier to film . \nsociety has changed a bit by that time , but it has advanced surprisingly little . \napparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control . \nand from carpenter\'s view , women have really made a mess of things . \nsociety has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten . \nthe basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony . \ninstead of having the criminal \" napolean \" wilson , this film has the criminal \" desolation \" williams . \ninstead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face , well , ghosts of mars . \nbecause the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner , but they essentially behave as human savages , in another lapse of imagination . \nthe story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback . \nghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black . \ncarpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat . \nsadly what follows is not really up to the buildup . \nthe terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss . \nhis idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring . \nthese are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience . \nsomewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights . \nwithin a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars , red planet , and ghosts of mars . \nafter mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by . \ni rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \nfollowing the movie i showed my wife , who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did , carpenter\'s classic assault on precinct 13 . \nher comment is that it was seeing the same film twice . \n',neg
'so ask yourself what \" 8mm \" ( \" eight millimeter \" ) is really all about . \nis it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ? \nis it about the business itself , how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana , there\'s a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won\'t necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ? \nor is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ? \ni\'m not talking about snuff films , supposed \" documentaries \" of victims being brutalized and killed on camera . \ni\'m talking about films like \" 8mm \" and its director , joel schumacher . \nwith a recent run of big budget movies to his credit-- \" batman & robin , \" \" a time to kill , \" \" batman forever , \" \" the client \" --schumacher certainly has that kind of influence . \nis \" 8mm \" something you really want to see ? \nprobably not . \nthe first two-thirds of \" 8mm \" unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama , albeit with a particularly unsavory core . \nthen , as it\'s been threatening all along , the film explodes into violence . \nand just when you think it\'s finally over , schumacher tags on a ridiculous self-righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further . \ntrust me . \nthere are better ways to waste two hours of your life . \nnicolas \' \" snake eyes \" \' cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husband\'s safe documents a young girl\'s murder . \nwelles goes about his assignment rather matter-of-factly , and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly , almost as if you don\'t need any specialized skills or training to do this . \nwelles certainly makes it look easy . \nand cops , obviously , never look in toilet tanks for clues . \nthe deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes , like george c . scott in paul schrader\'s \" hardcore . \" \noccasionally , a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector , reminding him of his unpleasant task . \nthere are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife , played by catherine keener , who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split-level home in harrisburg , pa . \n \" 8mm \" doesn\'t condemn or condone its subject matter , it just exploits it . \nthe irony , of course , is that schumacher and \" seven \" scribe andrew kevin walker\'s vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r-rated , first-run hollywood product . \nso we only see snippets of snuff , and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror . \nlater it\'s the turn of joaquin phoenix ( who\'s quite good and by far the film\'s most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california ) to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again . \nall this to get to the familiar yet offensive \" revelation \" that sexual deviants are not , indeed , monsters but everyday people like you and me . \nneither super nor standard , \" 8mm \" is shocking only in its banality . \n',neg
'that\'s exactly how long the movie felt to me . \nthere weren\'t even nine laughs in nine months . \nit\'s a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man , mr . hugh grant , a huge dork . \nit\'s not the whole oral-sex/prostitution thing ( referring to grant , not me ) that bugs me , it\'s the fact that grant is annoying . \nnot just adam sandler-annoying , we\'re talking jim carrey-annoying . \nsince when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting ? \nbut , on the other hand , since when do really bad slapstick ( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant\'s head in joan cusack\'s lap--a scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie ) and obscene double entendres ( robin williams , the obstetrician , tells grant\'s pregnant girlfriend she has \" a big pussy , \" referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat , but nonetheless , grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie ) pass for comedy ? \nnine months is a predictable cookie-cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot . \nhugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist . \nwhy a child psychologist ? \nso the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange : \nkid : my dad\'s an asshole . \ngrant ( flutters eyelashes , offers a nervous smile , then responds in his annoying english accent and i-think-i-actually-have- talent attitude ) : could you possibly elaborate on that ? \nkid : my dad\'s a _huge_ asshole . \nmore like a hugh asshole , but that\'s beside the point , which is : nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief . \nso , anyway , grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction ( fluttered eyelashes , nervous smiles ) . \nthis paves the way for every possible pregnancy/child birth gag in the book , especially since grant\'s equally annoying friend\'s wife is also pregnant . \nthe annoying friend is played by tom arnold , who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick , none of which is funny , such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed \" arnie the dinosaur \" ( you draw your own parallels on that one ) in a toy store . \nthe only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum , who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway , as an artist with a fear of ( and simultaneous longing for ) commitment . \nnot even robin williams , who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics , has much humor . \nhis is a one-joke character-- the old foreign-guy-who-mispronounces-english stereotype ( did someone say yakov smirnov ? \nthat\'s my favorite vodka , by the way ) , hence the line \" now it\'s time to take a look at your volvo , \" another nasty but unamusing joke , except this one goes right over the ten year olds\' heads , while the adults simultaneously groan . \nnine months is a complete failure , low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud , unfunny slapstick , failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy . \nhugh grant\'s sunset boulevard arrest ( please , no caught-with-his-pants-down jokes ) may bring more people into the theaters , but they certainly won\'t leave with a smile on their faces , not after 90 minutes of grant\'s nervous smiles . \neverything in the movie is so forced , so unauthentic that anyone with an i . q . \nover 80 ( sorry , hugh ) will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire . \nbut at least they didn\'t spend 60 bucks for it . \n',neg
'call it a road trip for the walking wounded . \nstellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it\'s difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence . \nyet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama . \nplaywright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late . \nthat\'s an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) . \nthey haven\'t spoken in years , and wouldn\'t even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren\'t for kaisa\'s mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer . \nin a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live . \n ( only in the movies , right ? ) \ntoo blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa . \nloathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn\'t muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . \ndespite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn\'t fallen very far from the tree . \nkaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper . \nain\'t they a pair ? \nunable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative . \nby the time they reach the hospital , it\'s time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they\'re also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . \nthis revelation exists purely for its own sake . \naberdeen doesn\'t know where else to go . \nweak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa . \nif lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) . \nheadey\'s too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance . \nif she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe she\'d figure out that doing less can reveal so much more . \nit\'s worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter\'s captivating signs & wonders . \nit\'s not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( they\'re not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) . \nthe differences in the way their characters were presented is significant . \nin aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed . \ndespite skarsg ? rd\'s solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow . \nthere\'s genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity . \nnossiter\'s film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . \nif signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it\'s willing to stretch beyond what we\'ve come to expect from traditional drama . \naberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies . \nwhen did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ? \nthe depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan\'s trite but occasionally useful grand canyon , where steve martin\'s hollywood mogul pronounces , \" all of life\'s riddles are answered in the movies ! \" \neven foreign films are taking that advice to heart . \n',neg

'best remembered for his understated performance as dr . hannibal lecter in michael mann\'s forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on . \nusually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he\'s only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do . \nif you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach\'s hidden agenda . \ncox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l . i . e . , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge . \nbig john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad . \nwhat bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light . \nhe\'s an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids\' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives . ) \nhe\'ll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world . \nl . i . e . stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia . \nfilmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano ) . \nin his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l . i . e . \nhighway deaths of filmmaker alan j . pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52 . \nhe\'s both fascinated and disturbed by the l . i . e . , and those feelings are projected onto big john ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn\'t want to do . \nthis makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he\'s a beast , but ashamed of it . ) \nl . i . e . would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie\'s ill-advised foray into big john\'s haven . \nthere is unnecessary padding with howie\'s miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime , degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger . \nrather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length . \nconcurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted . \ncox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster . \ndano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent . \nwe\'re so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) , it\'s surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene . \nthe restraint is admirable . \nbut l . i . e . \'s screenplay doesn\'t always give them the best material . \nwhen howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious . \ndirector michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach\'s goldberg variations . \nit\'s too much . \nthere are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john\'s other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie . \nthis plot thread predictably leads to violence . \nnot content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff\'s superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note . \nit\'s typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note . \nin this regard , l . i . e . \n ( and countless other indie films ) share something in common with blockbuster action films : problems are solved when the obstacle is removed . \nhow often does real life work this way ? \nto extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism , do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion ? \n',neg
'janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker . \nthis is a by-the-books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs . \nit also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there , too . \ngarofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection . \ndenis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that\'s made the kennedy family so popular . \nso leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit . \nshe soon learns why \" easier said than done \" is the mantra of movies like this . \nthe matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong -- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland , almost misses the bus to town , can\'t get a hotel room , ends up in the smallest , trashiest one around , has a dog piss on her luggage , and so on . \nthen comes what roger ebert calls the \" meet cute . \" \nit happens in every romance : the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional , cinematic way . \nin the matchmaker , it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean ( david o\'hara ) in the bathtub , his dog sitting at his side . \nno points for guessing it\'s the same dog that just made water on her luggage . \nalso no points for guessing garofalo hates o\'hara on sight . \nthat\'s how it works in movies like these . \ni know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she\'d hate him for awhile , then succumb to his charms , live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil , after which they\'d reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits . \ni haven\'t mentioned the movie\'s twist yet . \ngarofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival , during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss . \nmilo o\'shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together . \nrest assured he\'ll do all he can to match up garofalo and o\'hara . \noh , and in keeping with the matchmaker\'s utter predictability , he dies toward the end . \nwhat the message here ? \nsometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction , like garofalo , will sell out with a weak script . \ni was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie , but they actually only have two or three scenes together . \nleary stays stateside , for the most part , yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole . \nhe even undoes himself with the old microphone\'s still on after he\'s done giving the speech cliche . \nboth of them should have known better . \n',neg
'and now the high-flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics , and it isn\'t pretty . \nthis time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas\'s the three musketeers . \nby bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting . \nthe end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu . \nthe story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay . \nd\'artagnan ( justin chambers ) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer . \nhe travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents . \nin paris , he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) , who is trying to overthrow the king , and richelieu\'s man-in-black associate febre ( tim roth ) , the killer of his folks . \nhe finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk , so he rounds up aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steven spiers ) to free the musketeer\'s wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king\'s prison . \nd\'artagnan and his new frisky love interest/chambermaid francesca ( mena suvari ) play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen ( catherine deneuve ) ends up being captured by the menancing febre , forcing the musketeers to regroup , with d\'artagnan leading the charge , and save the day . \ndirector peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it\'s a disaster . \none problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones . \njet li\'s high risk is a rip-off of die hard -- not the other way around . \nironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes . \nmost asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences , because they know the scenes have to carry the picture . \nthe musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano ( sudden death ) , horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth , and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers ( the wedding planner ) to deliver his mousy self as a leader . \nchambers\' d\'artangnan isn\'t a musketeer -- he\'s a mouseketeer ! \nand hyam\'s use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted , but that\'s the only standout in an overall flat production . \n',neg
'a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . \nfirst , there\'s the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . \nbut occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . \nno no . . . \njust kidding . \nhad you going there for a moment , didn\'t i ? \nin all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . \nthe first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it\'s 5 billion inhabitants ) . \nthe mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . \nunfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . \nthe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . \ni\'d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn\'t know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . \nthe writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn\'t try to overachieve . \nthere were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . \nand , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . \nmortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . \nshao khan has decided that he\'s going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . \nthereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . \none gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought \" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . \" \ntoo bad they didn\'t simply stick with the formula from the first movie . \ni could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : \n * the acting is truly bad . \nsandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . \n * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i\'ve * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . \nin the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . \ni generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim \" tiny \" lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite \" utility \" actors but he\'s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn\'t even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . \n * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . \n * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . \nfor these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . \n . . . unless you\'re a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . \nin that case , the following critiques also apply : \n * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . \nwilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . \nhess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . \n * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . \nsonya does her \" kiss of death , \" jax does his \" earthquake , \" liu kang does his \" animality , \" and so on . \na big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . \n * there aren\'t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . \nsilly , silly folks . \nand the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . \nlame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . \n * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their \" animalities . \" \nmotaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . \nfor folks like myself who loved the first movie and

'john carpenter makes b-movies . \nalways has ( \" halloween , \" \" escape from new york , \" \" the thing \" ) and , by the looks of it ( \" they live , \" \" escape from l . a . , \" \" vampires \" ) , always will . \ncarpenter\'s latest horror opus with a science fiction bent ( or science fiction outing with a schlock horror bent ) is the aptly-titled \" john carpenter\'s ghosts of mars \" ( in case , i suppose , you went looking for someone else\'s \" ghosts of mars \" ) . \nlike all those films prefixed by the very possessive \" john carpenter\'s , \" \" ghosts of mars \" is an unashamed b-movie punctuated by a b-movie plot , b-movie actors , and b-movie special effects . \nin category one , above , we have a storyline that borders on idiotic ( and , at times , chaotic ) . \ndormant martians ( i . e . , swirling red gases ) awakened by meddling humans possess the souls of hapless mining colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes . \nall this explained ( in flashback ) to some grand pooh-bah counsel by martian police official melanie ballard ( natasha henstridge , from the sub- \" species \" films ) , the only returnee on a silly-looking train . \nofficer ballard went in to bring back incarcerated felon james \" desolation \" williams ; what she found was not a pretty picture . \nin the second category we have ms . henstridge , her blonde hair pulled back tightly and awkwardly into a ponytail , ice cube ( as the appropriately-named \" desolation \" ) , pam grier ( briefly , oddly--who wanted to work with whom i wonder ? ) , and a host of extras all assuming that the story and special effects were going to carry this film and therefore they didn\'t need to try too hard . \nin category number three we have , in addition to those swirling red gases and the silly-looking train , a couple of bird\'s-eye-view shots of a sprawling martian metropolis ( reddish also ) . \nstate-of-the-art special effects have never been a carpenter trademark and once again the writer/director ( who seems to have no problem finding work , however ) doesn\'t waste any of the film\'s budget in that department . \n \" ghosts of mars \" is lock , laughing stock , and barrel all your standard carpenter fare : dingy interiors , cluttered exteriors , inane dialogue , lots of leather , scarred , crazed-looking aliens , and lots and lots of weaponry . \nthe film often and always explodes into warfare without warning--spontaneously , stupidly . \ncarpenter might like to think he\'s made a western here but it\'s a western without any real heroes , villains , or border conflicts . \nit\'s just the shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken . \ni never thought i\'d miss the guy but i do . \nit\'s not * all * the same , however . \ndubbed the \" one-note wonder \" for his minimalist music soundtracks , carpenter seems to have graduated from simplistic ( yet effective ) scoring by highlighting his action with loud , screeching guitar work . \nfortunately this drowns out a lot of the dialogue . \nthe final exchange between henstridge and , er , cube though is both audible * and * priceless . \nmars has proven an infertile breeding ground for hollywood in the last year or so , what with the stillborn \" mission to mars \" and \" red planet \" ( with val kilmer ) . \n \" ghosts of mars \" sadly adds to those disappointing returns ( in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by a bunch of sequels , among them \" american pie 2 \" and \" rush hour 2 \" ) . \nthe irony is that the mars in carpenter\'s film feels sadly absent . \nthere are occasional references to the red planet , of course , but the film might as well have been set in perth amboys than on earth\'s closest neighbor . \ntwo things keep \" john carpenter\'s ghosts of mars \" from getting a huge slap upside the head . \n1 . \nhenstridge keeps her top on ( miraculously ) , and 2 . the film doesn\'t pretend to be anything it\'s not . \nwhat that means , however , is that fans of superior , intelligent , grade a sci-fi/horror are singularly out of luck . \n',neg
'i\'m really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone . \nsure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god\'s green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out . \nthe crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff . \nhideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in . \nclueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time . \nand people have e-mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i\'m the only one who doesn\'t like it . \none girl said if i\'d seen the movie with \" an open mind , \" i would have enjoyed it . \nnothing could be further from the truth . \ni went into the theater expecting to love the movie . \nthe preview looked good and of course i\'m crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters . \nalmost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way . \nwhen we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn\'t me ) yelled out , \" that was the worst f$&#in\' movie i\'ve ever seen \" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement . \nso last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia\'s pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter . \ni knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i\'ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway . \nwhat i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever . \nand you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like . \nwhere to begin in criticizing this movie ? \nthe plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she\'s still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever . \nthere is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence . \nzero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero . \nso why does this movie get one star out of me ? \nwell , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub . \nand if it wasn\'t bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get . \nalicia plays a babysitter who\'s spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party . \nand of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) . \nas the movie trods along , we discover she\'s not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character\'s fantasies ( and probably every male viewer\'s too ) . \nthe drunken father thinks she\'s just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she\'s taking her bubble bath . \nthey even throw in the middle aged wife\'s fantasies about a male counterpart at the party . \nnot that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy . \nat least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated . \nin fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there\'s absolutely no nudity in it . \nso you can\'t call it a sex flick . \ni\'ve already pointed out that it can\'t fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ? \nbad . \n',neg

'mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla . \nhis entrance , however , is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have . \njoe bellows at the poachers before him , angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars . \nduring this scene , i turned to my friend and said , \" wow . \nthat\'s some ape . \" \njoe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla . \nhe runs around the fields , chasing cars and people . \nhe picks things up and stares at them pensively . \nhe breaks things on accident , because he\'s just too big to avoid clumsiness . \njoe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes . \nas a character , he doesn\'t quite register . \nand the story he\'s been put in is as limp as they come . \nthe words \" family entertainment \" have never been a stamp of quality , but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart . \nthe picture is a remake of the 1949 film . \nit\'s mostly just about the big gorilla , but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters . \nthe main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas . \nas a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife . \nspecifically , she\'s out to protect joe , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood . \nsoon , zoologist gregg o\'hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill\'s mother . \nso , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers . \nin addition , the space is way too small for him ( after all , he is a really big gorilla ) . \nand , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe ) , and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill\'s mother . \njill , of course , doesn\'t recognize strasser , even though he did kill her mother . \nthis is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film . \nthe movie isn\'t really offensive -- it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla . \nbut the story is really dumb , there aren\'t any characters , and the film isn\'t satisfying on any level beyond its visuals . \nthe movie also has bad dialogue . \nif a critic says that a film has bad dialogue , it\'s only fair to quote some of it , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like \" joe isn\'t happy ! \" \nand \" joe isn\'t safe here ! \" \n \" we need to get joe out of here ! \" \n \" joe is way too big for that cage ! \" \ni don\'t know if these phrases are word for word , but they\'re close . \nas i said , the characters here are only present as a formality : they do little more than state the obvious ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage ) . \npaxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them . \nsadly , mighty joe young wastes them both . \nthere are a few clever moments ( although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment ) , and , as i said , the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes . \nit\'s certainly not a bad film for kids ; i doubt joe will give them nightmares . \nbut adults in the audience aren\'t likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla . \na big gorilla is only interesting for a little while ; after that , something needs to be done with the big gorilla . \nnobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla . \n',neg

' \" knock off \" is exactly that : a cheap knock off of an action movie . \nit\'s also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year . \ni figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998 , but alas , it has already been found . \njean-claude van damme stars as ( i think ) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half-brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods . \nrob schneider plays van damme\'s partner , and rochon plays . . . \nactually , i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be . \nshe just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there . \nmany things are not explained in this film , but i do know that for some bizarre reason , van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick . \nwhere chan comes off as endearing in his \" normal guy \" character seen in many of his films , van damme just comes off as a wimp . \nwe\'re never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions . \nto be more clear : i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie , and even then , it was not made too clear . \nthe film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong . \ntsui hark ( who directed van damme\'s last movie , the bad , but not nearly as bad as this , \" double team \" ) never lets the camera rest for a second , and that\'s no exaggeration . \nwe are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme\'s foot entering a shoe . \nfabulous ! \nseriously , though , i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions , as long as they don\'t get carried away . \nfor example , look at sam raimi . \n \" army of darkness \" , one of his best movies , features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen , but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story . \nthat\'s a concept that tsui can\'t seem to grasp . \nthe special effects and outrageous camera angles * rule * \" knock off \" to the point where the audience doesn\'t have a clue as to what\'s happening any more . \nanother problem with the film is that it looks cheap . \nthe film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night . \nand for some inexplicable reason , everyone\'s voice seems to have been dubbed . \neven the stars . \nand even the special effects , seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about , are inconsistent . \nfor example , there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window . \nthe car slams into the ground , and the left wheel is completely destroyed . \nseconds later , the car drives off at full speed . \nhey , i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie , but a line must be drawn somewhere . \nfinally , the acting . \nnobody gives a good performance in this film . \nvan damme , an actor i usually like , is way off the mark playing \" everyman \" . \nand schneider , here to provide comic relief i assume , is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene . \neven the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over-the-top performance as . . . \nonce again , i have no idea who he was supposed to be . \nin case i haven\'t yet made it clear enough , \" knock off \" is the worst movie of van damme\'s career and possibly the worst movie of the decade . \nand it\'s not even one of those movies that\'s so bad it\'s funny . \nit\'s too inept to be funny . \nthere are no redeeming factors in \" knock off \" and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased . \n',neg
' \" snake eyes \" is the most aggravating kind of movie : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing . \nit\'s not just because this is a brian depalma film , and since he\'s a great director and one who\'s films are always greeted with at least some fanfare . \nand it\'s not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance , this film is hardly worth his talents . \nit\'s worse than that . \nit\'s aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more , could be totally intelligent , and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely . . . then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness . \nor more deservedly , the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness . \nin certain circles , \" snake eyes \" was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa\'s classic \" rashomon , \" where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives , and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening , which , i might add , is superb . \nin one very very very long steadicam shot , we meet the protagonist , crooked atlantic city detective , rick santoro ( cage ) , and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife , interupts a pay-per-view event on tv , chases down a gambler , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight , sits down and talks with his bud , kevin dunne ( gary sinise , who\'s character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn , who\'s also in this ) , and watches as it happens . \nthere\'s a big name in the crowd , and that\'s the secretary of defense , charles kirkland ( joel fabiani ) , who\'s sitting behind rick , and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion , lincoln tyler ( stan shaw ) , is knocked out . \nthis all happens in the opening shot , and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction . \nwhat really happened , this film asks , and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene . . . and \ndiscovers there\'s a very good possibility it was a conspiracy . \nas we follow rick trying to learn of more information , we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot ( carla gugino ) , and who flees the scene in a panic , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness\' takes on what happened . \nthis is all going pretty fine and dandy , and it\'s extremely interesting to watch . . . then \nit takes one wrong step . \nwe follow the wrong character , and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on , and way before rick can find it out . \nbut that\'s not the worst part of it : it\'s that it\'s the one person you didn\'t think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring , the one you didn\'t think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it . \nit only gets worse : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film , and since we already know what happened , we can\'t rely on rick\'s investigation to be all that interesting . \nit\'s as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in , and decided to just fall back on an easy way out , and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible . \nevents become more and more proposterous , and by the end , the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this : the deux ex machina . \nthat\'s where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay . \nthis time , it\'s a hurricane , an out-of-control police car , and a big round ball that adorned the arena . \nwhat went wrong ? \ndepalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this . \ndepalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , \" blow out , \" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece . \nbut granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries . \nat least his direction makes up partly for it . \nthen there\'s koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character\'s flaws come to life like he did in depalma\'s earlier \" carlito\'s way , \" a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well . \nhe can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort . \nhe\'s flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn\'t so formulaic . \na scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup . \nhe may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like . \nthis is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way . \nas i was watching the first half hour , i couldn\'t wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed , how many different perspectives he\'d be given , and perhaps he\'d have to make a choice between who\'s he has to believe . \nnow there\'s a film . \nunfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we\'ve seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma . \n',neg
'forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects . \nset in 1692 at salem , massachusetts , the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon . \nthey beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells . \nthen one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes . \nnot to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) , abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood . \ntaking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken-bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ? \nsurely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ? \nthe crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller\'s name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play . \nthis is far from a harmless event , a bad start to an already shaky morality tale . \nthe play describes the film\'s opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply , and this adds to the play\'s charged atmosphere . \nin the film , the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora\'s box . \nnot only is credulity stretched but abigail\'s obsession is unfortunately spotlighted . \nit positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ; it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot . \nnot surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning , witches are invoked by those eager to blame . \nwhen the girls are questioned , their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses , led lustfully by abigail . \nwith alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents , constant reminders that abigail\'s passion sets all this into inexorable motion . \nabigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor\'s love , his wife elizabeth ( joan allen ) , by including her among those accused of witchcraft . \nappropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) , day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over-earnestness that longs to be watched . \ndirector nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis\' foaming-mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration . \notherwise , hytner\'s direction is unremarkable . \nryder\'s performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings . \nher fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful . \nabigail supposedly revels in her newfound power , but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here . \npaul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth , but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves . \nprobably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing , allen\'s elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character . \na scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed . \nunfortunately , when john\'s audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost . \nit is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions . \nhis screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message . \nthe result is a clumsy muddle - i felt like the chicken from the opening scene , head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy-handed to be wholly believable . \nwhen the gallows beckoned , it was sweet release indeed . \nfar from bewitching , the crucible tests the patience . \n',neg
'one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film . \nafter all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave . \nhe is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing . \nhowever , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year . \nthe abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation . \nthese four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly . \nit is edgar\'s ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : \" it\'s only when things are over that they make sense . \" \nwhether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided . \nthe thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone . \ninstead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last . \nonly once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you\'re so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it . \nbut don\'t fret , it will surface again . \nyou could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile . \nbut you hold hope for some time . \nthe background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations . \nit\'s only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope . \nand with speeches like , \" i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , \" how can you expect to hold anyone\'s interest ? \nto godard\'s credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene . \nthe black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful . \nwatching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him . \nand if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities . \nthe environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them . \nunfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene . \nsometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words . \nthe second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image . \nyou suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners . \nthe only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies . \nsteven spielberg is picked on in particular . \nwhile i\'ll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it\'s still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood . \nit just goes to show , an intelligent person isn\'t necessarily an admirable storyteller . \nthe days of breathless are no more . \n',neg

'reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) . \nthe guy can\'t seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : \" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel \" ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) . \nhis screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight . \ni can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , \" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! \" \nit\'s almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie . \nand why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? \nauteur theory be damned ; it\'s kruger\'s \" style \" , not the director\'s that winds up on screen . \nkruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut \" sometimes less is more \" . \nand his numerous twists can\'t even claim to be originals ; arlington rd\'s ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol\' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn\'t know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the \" character \" . . . grammar \nbe damned ) . \n \" how did you know that ? \" \nthe stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along . \n . \n . \nsince twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger\'s screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it\'s no wonder why he works so frequently . \nhe\'s quickly becoming miramax\'s mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects . \nthis is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles . \ntheir company\'s current logo could be \" we ride the trends \" . \nreindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head . \nalthough affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick . \naffleck is such a puppy dog that it\'s impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone\'s bitch . \nthe role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent \" serious \" movie getting . \nit may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who\'s played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) \njames frain is nick , rudy\'s cellmate , a manslaughterer who\'s found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) . \nashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she\'s never seen one picture of him . \nwhich works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley\'s brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts . \nhe plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino . \nthough by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i\'ve described might as well be irrelevant . \nthis is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner . \nincluded : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) . \nthough it\'s an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience . \nthe flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up . \nit would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau \n ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this . \nhe films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart . \nproblem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play . \ncharacter problems abound ;

'a follow-up to disney\'s live-action \" 101 dalmatians \" that\'s better , more entertaining than the first ? \njust as unlikely . \nwith \" 102 dalmatians , \" the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs , more is definitely * not * the merrier . \n1996\'s \" 101 dalmatians \" certainly wasn\'t the greatest movie-going experience of all time , but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous , larger-than-life performance . \nin addition , we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson , and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies . \nthis time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen , and close\'s facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers . \nbut that\'s only half the problem with kevin lima\'s laborious film . \nwhat makes \" 102 dalmatians \" such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he\'s a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic \" heroes \" of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? . \ngruffudd is cute and harmless , perhaps , but evans can\'t even aspire to that . \nthe dogs upstage them both , of course , but in the case of evans , even close\'s split ends are more animated . \nbad acting , however , seems to be a requirement for this sequel , since g ? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro\'s in \" men of honor . \" \njean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieu\'s over-the-top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail , and wail for wail . \nfrance\'s most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself , and in \" 102 dalmatians \" the producers milk that realization for all it\'s worth--le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as \" poopies , \" par example ( and ad nauseum ) . \nthe finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with , since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) . \nthat done , it\'s back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off-limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown . \nthe dogs are pretty cute--try making a puppy look otherwise--but that\'s pretty much all they are . \nthere\'s always the feeling that there\'s a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder . \nsavvy holiday goers should skip \" 102 dalmatians \" and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead . \nit\'s one dalmatian less , but 101\% more satisfying . \n',neg

'play it to the bone , the newest addition to ron shelton\'s sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways . \nlike most of shelton\'s other great films ( bull durham , white men can\'t jump ) , this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots . \nshelton\'s films are not considered sports films , but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story . \nshelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions . \nplay it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull , but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse . \nthe film has no social message like its predecessors . \nthe relationship between the friends , two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars , is very confusing for a number of reasons . \nthe whole film , since it is primarily a \" buddy picture , \" depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other . \nunfortunately , it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below . \n1 ) we never see how cesar ( antonio banderas ) and vince ( woody harrelson ) meet . \nthe two are so different from each other , that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory . \n2 ) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas . \nthere is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something . \n3 ) the third character on the trip , grace ( lolita davidovich ) stands in the way . \nshe is in nearly every scene with them , making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other . \n4 ) there are two many interfering , irrelevant side stories . \nvince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis , cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry , and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner . \nthese boring tales only hurt the central plot . \n5 ) when it comes to time for the two men to fight , they don\'t even hesitate to pound each other . \nwasn\'t the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other ? \nby the time the road trip part of the movie is over with , the film wants to be over . \nshelton , on the other hand , continues to tell his story . \nforty five painful minutes remain . \nthe boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies . \nhowever , the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile , kind of like the whole film . \n',neg
'some movies i should just skip . \nmy daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program . \ntrue , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it\'s a cartoon . \nbut it\'s a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen . \nbut my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ? \nturns out i was right , mostly . \ninspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick . \nat first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver . \nthis odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where \" formula \" isn\'t just business , it\'s a way of life . \nthe producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits . \nin some parts you can just hear them saying \" more zany ! \ni want more zany here -- and -- here . \" \n \" let\'s have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful . \ni want the audience squirming in their seats . \" \n \" ok , that\'s fine , but i want you to add bug guts . \" \n \" what does this scene do ? \ncharacter depth ? \nbut where\'s the zaniness ? \ni don\'t see zany here . \nif you can\'t make it zany , cut it ! \" \nthe latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie . \nmichelle ( who plays penny , gadget\'s niece ) shines in every scene she\'s in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time . \nmy guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor . \ndabney coleman\'s comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby . \ni kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes . \nhe is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the \" gidget bitch from hell \" town mayor . \noteri\'s overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon\'s own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn\'t poking fun at our fair town . \nor , maybe all career politicians are like that . \ni must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla . \nhe appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget . \nrupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw . \njoely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself . \nher performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film . \nd . l . hughley plays the shuckin\'-and-jivin\' vehicular side-kick , in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years . \nthe dialog is . . . let\'s face it , it\'s pretty bad . \nthe tag-line after a major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context . \na lot of the lines ( especially hughley\'s ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad-lib . \nabout three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw . \ngadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really \" battles \" ) with the evil gadget . \npenny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon . \nlet me rage here just for a minute . \nmichelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character . \nshe\'s utterly charming , and has excellent experience ( harriet the spy ) for the part of the pint-size detective . \nwhy she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery . \nthe film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting ( or editing ) stupidity . \ninspector gadget is missing the long , long stretches of potty humor that ( among other things ) made my favorite martian so unbearable , but it\'s a very short movie , so perhaps something was cut at the last moment . \nprobably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits . \nthe \" evil sidekick support group \" is especially worth seeing , and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it\'s onscreen . \nall in all , another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films . \ni wonder if disney uses the revenues for it\'s generally money-making cartoons to produce these losers . \nbut if true , why ? \nif they\'re trying for another mary poppins , they need to find a team that can produce one , and then give them a chance to do it . \n',neg
'hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell . \nthe last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films . \nin a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous . \nwith the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong\'s best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u . s . productions . \nsuch talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results . \nnow we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai . \nunfortunately \" romeo must die \" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong\'s rhythms . \nthe film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking . \nenter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) . \nkai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai\'s boss and leader of the local chinese family . \na battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down . \nit\'s not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends . \nthe following morning po sing is found dead . \nsuspicions escalate , as issac o\'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder . \nhis concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture . \nissac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter . \nthe scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder . \nhe fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined . \nhung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work . \nescaping to the u . s . han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother\'s death . \n \" romeo must die \" is in many ways a fun film . \nit is both absurd and assured . \nthe basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes \" the godfather \" . \nthe relationship between jet li\'s han and aaliyah\'s trish o\'day reminds us of abel ferrera\'s \" china girl \" , except that romeo must die\'s couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another . \ntheir romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history . \nthe performances are adequate if not fully acceptable . \nli , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination . \nallayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace . \nit\'s obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic . \nbut , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it . \ndelro lindo as issac o\'day carries himself well in the film . \nan unsung and under appreciated actor , mr . lindo turns out the films best performance . \nthe other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d . b . woodside as issac\'s son , colin . \nthe performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in . \nan unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written . \nfirst time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film . \nhaving a career as one of the industry\'s best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and \" romeo must die \" does look good . \nbut the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes . \nthe script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in . \nthe big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing . \nand of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah\'s bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever . \nthe best things about the film are its fight scenes . \njet li is a master of these intricate physical battles . \none needs only to see his film \" fist of legend \" to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat . \nhere , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that \" lethal weapon 4 \" ( jet\'s u . s . debut ) didn\'t allow . \nunfortunately , a lot of jet\'s fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision . \nalso \" romeo must die \" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x-ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent . \nobviously a homage to the famed x-ray scene from sonny chiba\'s \" streetfighter \" , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film . \nit\'s as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted . \none problem though about the fight scenes . \nthose that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon . \nthey do have an internal rhythm to them . \na heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography . \nthe fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance . \nthis is created by the performance , the direction and the editing . \nhere in \" romeo must die \" , there is no staccato . \nevery fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern . \nthe rhythm is monotonous . \na hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact . \n\'rmd\' is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever . \na fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan\'s films . . \nwatch the restaurant fight from the film \" rush hour \" and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not help ) . \nnow look at the warehouse fight from \" rumble in the bronx \" . \nthere you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that doesn\'t let the audience catch its breath . \nthe stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted . \nhere in \'romeo must die\' , the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl . \njet li is a grand and personable screen presence . \nit\'s a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here . \none day filmmakers here in the u . s . will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity . \nuntil then , we\'ll be left with emotionally hollow product like \" the replacement killer \" and , currently \" romeo must die \" . \n',neg

'among multitude of erotic thrillers , that had been released in the early 1990s , woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty , star of the b-grade action films of the previous decade . \nthose who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star . \nas director , ginty did very little to improve that impression . \nthe protagonist of the movie is jack ( played by jeff fahey ) , yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford ( played by bo derek ) . \nhowever , she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby ( steven bauer ) . \none stormy night , the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder . \nhowever , his good friend walter j . hill ( robert mitchum ) happens to be very good lawyer , so jack might even prove his innocence in the end . \nbelonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller , woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots . \nunfortunately , this film isn\'t comedy and any laugh is unintentional . \nthe characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them . \nthe actors that play them don\'t help either . \nthat is especially the case with jeff fahey , whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison . \nhis partner bo derek , on the other hand , shows that she didn\'t age enough to cease being the sex goddess , but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents . \nginty , on the other hand , tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting , but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer . \n',neg
' \" lake placid \" marks yet another entry in the series of \" predator pics \" that were a screen staple in the late 1970s ( post- \" jaws \" ) and were revived recently by the godawful \" anaconda . \" \n \" placid \" claims to be a \" horror/comedy \" -it\'s directed by the same guy who did \" house \" -but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of \" anaconda . \" \npaleontologist kelly scott ( bridget fonda ) is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body that had been bitten in half on the lake . \ndiscovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile ( which shouldn\'t even be in this hemisphere ) , kelly goes croc-hunting with game warden jack wells ( bill pullman ) and sheriff hank keough ( brendan gleeson ) . \nthey\'re joined by an unwelcome guest , hector cyr ( oliver platt ) , a scholar who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them . \nalong the way , the merry band meets mrs . delores bickerman ( betty white ) , a weird old lady who lives out on the lake . \nyou know what to expect from this movie : lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator ( croc cam ) swimming toward someone\'s dangling legs while \" jaws \" -like music plays , one character ( hector ) who\'s obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest , another character who insists that the predator can\'t possibly exist . \nunlike its slippery cousin \" anaconda , \" \" lake placid \" wants to present its formulaic plot tongue-in-cheek , which is self-defeating . \nthe result is neither scary nor funny ; it\'s just tedious . \nwhile director steve miner has several horror films on his resume ( including two installments of \" friday the 13th \" and \" halloween h20 \" ) , screenwriter david kelley ( best known as the creator of tv series like \" ally mcbeal \" and \" chicago hope \" ) doesn\'t seem to have the stomach for a chomp \'em up flick . \nthe body count is surprisingly low and doesn\'t include any of the major characters , and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it . \n ( \" lake placid \" manages to have it both ways-i\'ll let you discover how for yourself ) . \nthe croc itself is mostly computer-generated , of course . \nlike the snake in \" anaconda , \" the thirty-foot monster crocodile doesn\'t seem real ; it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural . \n \" lake placid \" also offers little explanation for why a giant crocodile is in maine . \nthere is a lot of semi-mystical mumbo jumbo about how \" we really don\'t know much about crocodiles . \" \nthey would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers . \na movie like this doesn\'t have to offer much of an explanation ( radioactive mutant ? \ncreature from outer space ? ) , but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on . \npullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto-pilot . \nmost of the time , they\'re probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers . \nplatt and white , on the other hand , seem to be giving their best efforts , and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry script . \n',neg
'capsule : where are you tonight , leni rienfenstal ? \nstarship troopers is an expensive , hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography -- and bad pornography , at that . \nit is not good cinema , not good storytelling , and not even stupid fun : it\'s so cynically , calculatedly bone-headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed . \nit\'s one of the worst movies i\'ve seen in a long time . \nwhy am i calling this movie pornography ? \npornography , in the abstract , is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts . \ni remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie , where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper , as \" a near-pornographic eternity \" . \ni didn\'t agree with that assessment , but i could see what was being implied : the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout \" do \'er , man , do \'er ! \" \nthat sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers . \nit\'s * literally * like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk . \nit tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening . \nthe film takes place in our future , when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn\'t appear to have intelligence . \nto counterattack , humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable : instead of nuke the planet from orbit , which they\'re clearly capable of , they send down grunts with m-16 rifles . \nthis isn\'t heinlein , it\'s a bad wwii movie , one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy , repetitive , and ultimately tiresome . \n ( one scene has a journalist on a battlefield , filimg soldiers being slaughtered , and ends with groaning predictability : said cameraman gets skewered , too . ) \nthe soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic . \nthey do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense . \nthey don\'t even behave like soldiers in a bad * movie * , and therefore we don\'t care about them . \nwe hated the tom berenger character in platoon , but he * mattered * , and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate . \nhere , we don\'t even hate the bugs -- what\'s there to hate ? \nhating them would be like cursing a hurricaine . \nif there\'s anything really hateful there , the movie doesn\'t know how to give it to us . \nthe screenwriter ( ed neumeier -- perhaps a better appelation would be \" screen typist \" ) and director ( the increasingly talent-impaired paul verhoeven ) have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other . \none of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who\'s great at getting out of tight situations , and does it again and again and again . \nonce or twice is fine . \nby the fifth or sixth time , it\'s worn out its welcome . \nthere\'s never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything , or really being tested to show their mettle . \nalso , the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry . \nif a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp , then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing . \nbut if one human gets cornered , he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip . \nuh-huh . \nthe very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi-fascist flavor . \ni say \" quasi- \" because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action -- the gear , the uniforms , etc . -- the movie doesn\'t have the nerve ( or the brains ) to be genuinely fascist , or intelligent about the subject . \nthe bumpers between scenes , which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda -- just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison . \nlike the rest of the movie . \nthere\'s more , i suppose , but it\'s not worth it . \nthe acting is bland , neither arsenic nor gravy ; the music disposable ; the camerawork turgid . \nthe heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece . \n',neg
'the classic story & the production which ruined it \nmarking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h . g . wells classic , new line cinema , armed with a stellar cast and expert make-up effects man stan winston ( alien , predator , terminator etc ) churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel . \nof course , the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies , one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 , under the title the island of lost souls ( sounds like a much better title . . ) . \nthe story begins with edward douglas ( thewlis ) , a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific , who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery ( kilmer ) after his plane crashes into the sea . \ndouglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr . moreau , who incidently , owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize . \nhis host\'s reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreau\'s lab , when a monstrous birth was in progress . \neven worse , the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal \" people . \" \ndouglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast-people community , which considers dr . moreau their maker . \nusing shock-therapy and the law , dr . moreau has long been able to keep his beast-people civilised to some extent but there are a few animal-men who are just too savage to be controlled . \nthe island of dr . \nmoreau questions the ability of men playing god . \ndr . moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings which is free from hate and violence . . . but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long . \nmoreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp . \neven so , the production has failed to make the most out of it . \nthere are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is , the characters are not \" prioritized \" so when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important , before they know it , he or she or it perishes . . . . rather \nungloriously at times too . \nperhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people , especially aissa ( balk ) , the most human of moreau\'s creations . \nthe two very important characters , montgomery and dr . moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably . \nmore screen time could have been used for character interaction and development . \ni really would have liked it better if , say , they delved more into dr . moreau\'s obsession , montgomery\'s purpose in the story and justification to as why the beast-people had to rebel . \nmaybe the nature of the screenplay , which incidently , does not incorporate much action sequences in the film , forced the filmmakers to \" cut a long story short \" and make it more of an action film than anything else ( it\'s still summer , and movies have to be \" marketable \" ) . \nthe special effects too , are really nothing for anyone to shout about . \nat most , i would say the beast-men looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes . \nthis h . g . wells classic really has potential to be a good film . \nunfortunately , after 2 adaptations , they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important message which makes up the entire essence of the story . \nas a third outing , the island of dr . moreau \naccomplishes little and is nothing more than an inferior version of `the planet of the apes\' . \nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n',neg

'out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller . \nthough the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it\'s not nearly good enough . \nin an aggressively non-linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) , a british ex-con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery . \nhe has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny . \nhe doesn\'t know much about the circumstances of her demise , all he has is a name : terry valentine . \nvalentine was jenny\'s former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive . \nhe\'s played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific ulee\'s gold in 1997 . \nseeking valentine\'s reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson . \nhe finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party . \nhe winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine\'s head of security and valentine himself , who decides to run for it . \nwhat a mess . \ni have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer . \nthe limey does exactly that . \nthe plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash-forwards and what can only be described as random time-travel , without any evident purpose . \nthere is no method to this movie\'s madness . \nit uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably . \nthe plot isn\'t particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving . \nthis is a sort of brooding film -- our protagonist doesn\'t speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude . \ni felt like the director wasn\'t very interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a paycheck . \nditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant . \nsixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal . \nhe\'s not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here . \npeter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor : he\'s shy , quiet but always effective . \nhe\'s adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression : his feelings don\'t always show on his face by you can always tell what they are . \nthis is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion . \nwhy soderbergh couldn\'t just parrot down and tell a story , i don\'t know , but what he does do certainly doesn\'t work . \nthe result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil -- even the action scenes don\'t work . \n1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline , but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it . \nshall we go back to basics ? \n',neg

'all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood . \nultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996\'s other , underperforming disaster films ( dante\'s peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year . \nbut , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank . \nno number of name changes can help this picture . \nit\'s not just about a disaster , it is a disaster . \nhard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute . \nthe best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises . \nthe community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies . \nfrom that moment on , it\'s all downhill . \nwhatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point . \nit takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured . \nbasically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs . \nthere\'s a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions . \nit\'s all very routine and uninteresting because there aren\'t any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense . \nthe film\'s conclusion is so preposterous that it\'s almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around . \naction films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion . \ngraham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle . \nunfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it . \nthe action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition . \nwe see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . -- over and over again . \nthe movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length . \nthe storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances . \nthere\'s tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash . \nhe and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv\'s \" lou grant \" ) , get stuck on a street that\'s rapidly turning into a river . \na group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers . \nafter charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs . \nas he swims and boats his way through huntingburg\'s roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives . \nthere isn\'t any real acting in this film . \nchristian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera . \ntom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen . \nrandy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing . \nmorgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script . \nfreeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time . \nfollowing in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn\'t trust nature\'s fury as the chief engine of conflict . \nas a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had . \ntitanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water . \nhard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible . \nthus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) . \nfortunately , there are only two elements left . \n',neg
'instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as \" powerful \" or \" touching \" . \ni have a name for it myself : \" gross \" . \nthis is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully , the bully looks at the \" rebel \" threateningly , about to hurt him , and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too . \nhow that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren\'t present day moviegoers beyond being \" inspired \" by something like that ? \nthis is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience\'s intelligence . \ninstinct\'s plot is brimming with potential : world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa . \nhe was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him . \nafter committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport , the authorities stick him in a prison\'s \" psychotics ward \" . \nassigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr . ) . \ncaulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career . \nof course ( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way ) he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison . \nand then there\'s the inevitable \" heartless meanie \" character , in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder\'s mentor . \nhe cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell . \nlet\'s get one thing straight : dr . theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen , on screen or off . \nany good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way . \nnot good old theo . \nno , he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says \" we need to talk about this right now . \" \nthis is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct\'s already dubious credibility ; unfortunately it\'s also the least of its problems . \ndirector jon turteltaub , who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that , contrary to what this movie\'s promotion would have you believe , it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs . \nit\'s not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes ( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that ) but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus ( excuse the graphic depiction ) . \nit aims to \" inspire \" rather than to touch hearts . \nas yoda would say , inspire it does not . \nit is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter ( the very experienced gerald di pego ) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie\'s story . \nindeed , somewhere in the beginning of instinct , one of the characters actually reads aloud the film\'s plot to another character . \nthis , like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review , is a horrid insult to our intelligence . \ni am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation . \ni think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors , and he chews the scenery in this movie , brilliant as ever . \noscar winner cuba gooding jr . on the other hand is dreadful . \nhis performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink . \ni liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling . \ni love animals , and instinct\'s prominent save the gorillas/live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with . \nhowever this movie\'s execution is completely unacceptable . \ntone down the violence and this will be a chick flick . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov \n',neg
'sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality . \nhe is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades , like twelve angry men , serpico or the verdict . \nbut , in the same time , almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet\'s reputation . \na stranger among us , 1992 rip-off of peter weir\'s witness , belongs to the latter category . \nthe heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith ) , tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york . \nduring one of such actions , her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result , she becomes depressed . \nin order to help her recover , bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community . \nemily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder . \nconcluding that the perpetrator belongs to community , she decides to go undercover . \nthat isn\'t easy , because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways . \nthings get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel ( eric thal ) . \nusing peter weir\'s formula isn\'t the greatest flaw of this film . \neven the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent . \nbut the worst insult to viewer\'s audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith . \nthe author of this review never liked this actress very much , but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles . \nrole of emily eden , unfortunately , isn\'t one of them . \nfirst of all , she can\'t pass for tough nypd street fighter , and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn\'t much better . \nscreenplay by robert j . avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots ( scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch ) . \nbut , on the other hand , other actors are more convincing ( lee richardson as an old rabbi , thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride ) , and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community . \nalso , the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture . \nthat is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time . \n',neg

'my giant is two movies for the price of one , but neither is worth the cost of admission , even if you get in free . \nas lamely directed by michael lehmann , the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book . \n ( \" without goliath , david is just some punk throwing rocks . \" ) \nlanguidly paced throughout , the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending . \nsince it\'s rarely funny or convincingly dramatic , what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery . \nother than a few nice visuals , there\'s nothing to recommend the picture . \nwith great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally ? to the original city slickers , billy crystal has shown that he\'s more than the world\'s best oscar host . \nhe does , however , have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year\'s father\'s day and this year\'s my giant . \none wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project . \nsurely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there . \nperhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success . \nor maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie\'s somber tone . \nthe most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day . \nthis one-joke movie\'s single idea is to place real-life basketball player gheorghe muresan , who stands seven and a half feet tall , into as many visually striking situations as possible . \nsammy ( crystal ) , an agent currently without clients , is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max ( muresan ) . \nafter throwing out constant one-liners ( \" either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car . \" ) , \nsammy decides to get serious , seeing max as his meal ticket . \nand although he doesn\'t like it , he\'s willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half-dozen dwarfs . \n ( the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever . ) \nafter a series of missed opportunities , the comedic part of the movie is over , and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie . \nwe learn that max\'s condition is terminal , and he will soon die . \nto be fair , the movie does contain a few good scenes - all of which you can see in the trailers . \nlet\'s hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie . \nmy giant runs too long even at just 1 : 37 . \nit is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up . \nmy son jeffrey and his friend matthew , both 9 , gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it . \nmatthew pointed out that it \" is not as good as it could have been or should have been . \" \n ( amen . ) \nhe went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle . \njeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was . \n',neg
'talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters ! \nspice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls . \nit\'s intended as a sort of hard day\'s night , but ends up simply hard to watch . \nwhen watching the spice girls , i\'m reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name . \nthe spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented . \nthere\'s ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far you\'re almost certain the post sticks out her throat . \nthe film itself doesn\'t really have a plot . \nit follows the girls as they travel here and there , culminating at their \" first live performance \" at albert hall . \nthe action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas . \nthe various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd . . . even \nwhen they start to sing ) , and an assorted number of musical performances , press conferences , and general all-around celebrity stuff . \nwhew . \nfor some reason , the film is littered with star cameos . \nfrom elton john to elvis costello , from bob hoskins to meat loaf . \nheck , even roger moore shows up , though he can\'t decide if he\'s parodying himself as james bond , or if he\'s lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld . \nrichard e . grant has the largest secondary part , a thankless role of the band\'s manager , clifford . \nthe celebrity spotting is partially amusing , and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film . \nneither amusing or spontaneous , when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring . \ntheir songs are alright , but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos . \nmy advice to fans is : stay home and watch that video collection , or at least spin that cd a couple of more times . . . either \noption will be more enjoyable than the film . \nnon-fans should know to stay well away from this one . \n',neg

'one of the responses those that enjoy \" detroit rock city \" ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i\'ve given the film might be something like : \" oh , that casey\'s gone and become a jaded critic on us . \njust what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n\' roll movie like this ? \" \ni\'m wondering the same thing . \ni feel like i should have had a grand time with \" detroit rock city . \" \nit\'s the sort of movie i wish i could\'ve had a lot of fun with , but i didn\'t . \ni just didn\'t . \nsurely this film isn\'t trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? \nno , but i expected something . \na funny joke . \na clever prank . \na plot development . \nanything . \nthe movie never delivers . \nyou\'ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . \n \" detroit rock city \" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film\'s existence , and it\'s not a very satisfying realization . \nthe film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . \nthat\'s it . \nthere is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot . \nthe characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . \nthey have a garage band . \nthey\'re pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n\' roll , so i guess that means we root for them . \nthey have tickets , they lose them . \nthey get more tickets , they lose those too . \nthey come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . \nthere\'s not much more to it . \nfrankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys\' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . \noh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . \nshe doesn\'t want them to see kiss , if you hadn\'t figured that out already . \nit\'s really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . \nwe\'ve got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . \nthen again , \" maximum overdrive \" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . \n \" detroit rock city \" doesn\'t quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . \nin fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . \nbasically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc\'s \" highway to hell \" sounds like something my neighbor\'s cat coughed up ) . \nit\'s also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it\' s evident that they\'re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . \nedward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they\'ve got to make a living in hollywood . \npeople wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . \ntoo bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess . \ndirector adam rifkin knows he hasn\'t got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . \nwe get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . \nit\'s fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . \ni would recommend that those who felt seasick at \" the blair witch project \" stay far away from \" detroit rock city , \" because the witch has got nothing on this baby . \ni haven\'t felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since \" armageddon . \" \nand what about that script ? \nit\'s written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i\'ve ever heard . \nif it is , i can\'t say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . \na plotless , pointless rock n\' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . \nthe jokes in \" detroit rock city \" rarely are . \nin fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . \nthe rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it \" comedy . \" \nthere is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don\'t provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up . \nit\'s as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , \" see ? \nfunny ! \" \nlook , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink . \nsee ? \nfunny ! \nlook , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver . \ntwice . \nsee ? \nfunny ! \nlook , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money . \nsee ? \nfunny ! \na word of advice to mr . dupr ? : no , these things aren\'t funny all by themselves . \nthey must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn \'t predicted them five minutes in advance . \nthat\'s it , i\'ve said enough about this movie . \nit\'s a waste of time and money . \ni liked the music , but don\'t bother buying the soundtrack . \ni hear it\' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie . \nyou want to see this concept executed well ? \ngo rent roger corman\'s 1979 classic \" rock n\' roll high school . \" \nit features another late-seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show . \nyes , go rent that , and skip \" detroit rock city , \" which will probably bomb , and deservedly so . \n',neg

'funny how your expectations can be defeated , and not in good ways . \nthe ghost and the darkness promised ( at least , it seemed to me to promise ) a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature . \nwhat it delivered was mystery science theater 3000-level material -- an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters . \n \" get new jobs ! \" \nwas one line , if i remember correctly . \nat the end of the 19th century , col . patterson ( val kilmer , whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr ) is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda . \nhe is having immensely stereotypical problems : the natives are restless , his boss is a jerk , and now two man-eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off . \npatterson tries to handle the situation himself , incompetently , and then turns to charles remington ( michael douglas ) , a hunter of world reknown ( or something like that ) . \nthe movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions , they should have gotten top billing and co-starred with siegfried and roy . \nthey are nigh-invulnerable , as one comic book put it , and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature . \ngive me a break . \nthe movie hasn\'t got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas ; it\'s just trying to find convenient ways to stall us . \neven the lion hunts themselves are idiotic . \nget this : remington\'s big plan is to build a large scaffold-like structure in the middle of the savannah , sit on it , and wait for the lion to show up . \nhe does this , and then gets knocked off by a bird . \nby the end of the movie , the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand . \nthe acting is forgettable . \ndouglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow , but it\'s nothing he hasn\'t done before . \nkilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else , somewhere else , and the rest vanish into the cinematography . \nthe camera , by the way , sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent . \nwhat did i expect from this movie ? \ni dunno . \nsome real excitement , i suppose . \na sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation . \nno such luck . \ni dug out my tattered copy of hemingway\'s \" the short happy life of francis macomber \" and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind . \n',neg

) \nfar too annoying far too often . \nlike in 1998s \" bulworth \" , when the movie was over i didn\'t care one little iota about the main character . \nat least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though . \n \" showgirls \" is too stupid to make a statement . \nsome people claim that the story is based on the legendary \" all about eve \" of all things ! \nif exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l . mankiewicz was , he\'d be . . . well , \nhe\'d be a good screenwriter . \ninstead , this project may have sunk his career . \nhe wrote the ( ha ha ! ) \nscript and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed . \nthe same team who created a good sex-film in 1992 ( \" basic instinct \" ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x-rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary ) lesbian overtones . \nthe predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer . \nafter the supposed street-smart young \" lady \" gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack-jawed yokel in the opening sequence , she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the \" stardust hotel \" . \nnomi doesn\'t take advantage of this contact to break into the big-time of dirty dancing right away . \nfirst , she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club . \nshe sells her hot little wares at \" the cheetah \" for a short time , turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience . \nhey , i never said she wasn\'t a hot number . . . \nmaybe it\'s that , her body , which gets her into the big-time when the star of the \" stardust hotel \" , crystal connors ( gina gershon ) stops into the strip club ( it certainly isn\'t her brains or pleasant disposition ! ) . \ncrystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan ) . \nhe also happens to be the pleasure-seeking worm who runs the big show . \ncrystal gets nomi onto the \" stardust \" team and , after an interminable amount of time , nomi \" earns \" the role of crystal\'s understudy . \nthe slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal . \nit was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she\'s \" not a whore \" . \nthat\'s a phrase we hear a few different times and it\'s completely ludicrous . \nof course she is ! \nshe sells her soul to make it big , but in the end we\'re supposed to believe that she\'s a better person than that . \nwe\'re supposed to root for her . \nno way ! \nshe\'s a tramp and a back-stabber who deserved nothing--least of all vindication in the . . . ahem . . . climax . \nshe is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is . \nthe sub-plot with a male dancer ( glenn plummer ) who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more . \nit sure ain\'t character development ! \nplummer also appeared in \" speed \" in \'94 in a smaller , yet better role . \nthis sub-plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control . \nkyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay-day or his standards have dipped since appearing in \" blue velvet \" . \nthat picture was weird , but some critics claim it\'s one of the best movies of the \'80s . \nnow ol\' kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the \'90s , too . \nhis sleazy character is important to \" showgirls \" , but we don\'t learn anything about him . \nhe uses people to get what he wants , but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie . \nis he a villain ? \nwho cares ! \nultimately , this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit . \neveryone must know by now about the soft-core acts of copulation , especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool . \nwhat few reviewers take issue with is how mean-spirited this movie is . \neveryone\'s either having sex , exacting revenge , or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge . \nit\'s just too hard to take ( especially for over two hours ) . \nif we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world , why couldn\'t verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers , grunts , and other sounds during the dance numbers ?

'mr . nice guy is the latest jackie chan film , so you should know what to expect . \na weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile . \nhowever , mr . nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie\'s best efforts , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever . \njackie chan plays , who else , jackie . \nthis time out , he\'s a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show . \nnot that it ever makes a difference in the plot . \nthere are only two scenes of him cooking . \nfor the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop . \nit never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills . . . perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ? \na tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons . \nalthough she only has one camcorder , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles . . . hmmm , \nshades of broadcast news ? ? ? \nanyway , the goons discover diana , and will do anything to recover the tape . \nhere lies another crucial flaw in the story : doesn\'t anyone realize you can copy a tape ? \noh well , no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense . \nas luck would have it , diana runs across jackie , and , wouldn\'t you know it , jackie accidentally ends up with the tape . \nthis leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie . \nin a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences , the film uses english as its primary language . \nhowever , that doesn\'t mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie\'s recent americanized releases . \nstrangely , many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english , and poorly too . \nwhether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie\'s dubbed films . \nthe plot in mr . nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons . \nbut even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie\'s films , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread . \nlook , if you have jackie chan playing a chef , why not use that to your advantage ? \nwatching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts . \nthe action is a mixed bag here . \nthere\'s really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie\'s films . \nit takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site , apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan . \nthe action in the film is neither jackie\'s best nor worst , but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes . \nthe film\'s gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting . \nonce or twice , it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence . \nbut to slo-mo jackie running ? \neither this is a nod to the six-million dollar man , or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down . \nif you\'ve seen all of jackie\'s films and are in need of another fix , go ahead and see mr . nice guy . \nhowever , if you\'re just in the mood for some good action , you\'d be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work , such as supercop . \n',neg
' \" first rule of fight club is , don\'t talk about fight club . \" \nthis quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it\'s not even worth mentioning . \ndirector david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge . \nwith crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i\'m surprised i didn\'t walk out . \nthis just goes to show that hype kills . \nit\'s very rare that a film so hyped up as \" fight club \" turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception . \nthe story goes like this . \nedward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter ) . \nnorton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended . \napparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain . \nwhy any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse . \nnorton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it\'s on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt ) . \nthe two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight . \nhow do they come up with this stuff ? \nanyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser\'s attention , and a club is formed . \nout of all this mess , there manages to lie a message . \nfincher shows us that society is like robots . \nwe work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out . \nour insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others . \ncall me crazy , but this is common knowledge . \ni think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably . \neven with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story . \ni couldn\'t help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp . \nit just shows how desperate the script is for attention . \ni guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself . \nhis bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee . \nit only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more . \nhelena bonham carter however really had no purpose . \nshe just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left . \nthis continues for what seems like 6 hours . \nthe film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while \" fight club \" nears what i think might be the end . \nunfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom . \nthough the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace . \non a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer . \nfincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson . \nconcentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won\'t do any good if everything else is in need of support . \nalso , i\'m afraid that immature men might respond to the film\'s violence . \nthe last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult . \nwhen the film ends , i\'m just glad to get home and take some advil . \nyou\'ll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says \" this is so f * * * ing stupid . \" \n',neg

'the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes , with everything ranging from \" l . a . confidential \" to \" palmetto \" to \" the big lebowski , \" has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran , talented directors . \nwith this particular genre , directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower-class and the glamorous , opulent upper-class , while maintaining the noirish , ambiguous ambience , the staple of film noir . \n \" wild things \" could be classified as a black comedy , a sultry film noir or a plain ol\' erotic thriller , but the one category it doesn\'t qualify for is that of a quality motion picture . \noveracted , overwrought and overlong , \" wild things \" is a confused mess , a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too . \nwith its incalculable twists , turns , more twists and more turns , it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness . \nin spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon , who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal , \" wild things \" not once jells in its eroticism , unpredictability , character motivation , sense of the world , plot , etc . there\'s not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical . \ndirected by john mcnaughton ( \" henry : portrait of a serial killer \" ) , \" wild things \" follows sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a hunkish , suburban florida high school teacher who\'s the dream of every spruced up female in the community . \nparticularly one . \nkelly van ryan ( denise richards ) adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner . \nsoon , her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike , enabling her to come into his house . \nnext thing , she cries rape . \nand the so-called \" roller-coaster ride \" ensues . \na second accuser comes front , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , a booze-drinkin\' , tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her , virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions , asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen . \neven bill murray gets into the act as lombardo\'s zany lawyer . \nhe wears a fake neck- brace , waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray . \nyou can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role . \nas ridiculous as it sounds , he\'s the most sane character in the movie . \nthe community is astonished . \nreporters flee to the scene . \nthere\'s an 8 . 5-million settlement for a libel suit against kelly\'s mother ( theresa russell ) . \nthere\'s the ambiguous cop ( kevin bacon , who also executive produced ) who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit , murder and lust . \nwe , the audience , sniff something not so lustful . \nlike so many thrillers these days , including \" the usual suspects \" and \" the game , \" \" wild things \" eschews character for plot . \nmcnaughton knows how to handle the camera , and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease , as if he knows the territory he\'s covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany \" henry , \" a furious , unsettling film directorial tour- de-force . \ngeorge clinton\'s score is a delight to behold . \nbut it\'s the humans . \nthe characters are mere devices for the \" nasty \" twists . \nwhat writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving , almost unbearable , if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting , don\'t feel real or we don\'t care for them . \nnot even the unintentionally funny moments work . \nthe people in \" wild things \" are not so much people as they are caricatures . \nthen there\'s the erotic content , which nearly earned the film an nc-17 , for a sexless , badly edited , poorly lit menage-a-trois . \nand in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country , kevin bacon\'s member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go . \nironically , the wildest elements of \" wild things \" are not wild at all . \n',neg

\nin this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark . \nthey didn\'t much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another . \none of jaws\' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories . \nthis is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we\'ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end . \nnot once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-i\'d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before \" action \" was called . \na male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don\'t bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery . \nto this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn\'t build a birdhouse . \nand if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i\'ve never been a prouder wimp my whole life . \n',neg
'there\'s a 1 , 000-foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact . \ni\'d say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies , which are getting more irwin allen- esque with every release . \nthe early wave of this revival , while just as cheesy and laughable , at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes . \ndeep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama , with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking . \nthe repeating cycle is as follows -- the president ( morgan freeman ) will go on tv and tell the country that there\'s a remote chance a comet will strike the earth , but that the nation\'s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . \nthen we get to see the plan in action , in some sequence utterly lacking suspense . \nthe mission will barely fail , and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth , and there\'s a remote chance it will strike , but that the nation\'s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . \nit goes on and on throughout the movie , but every time freeman goes on tv , we know his plan is going to fail . \nhow do we know this ? \nbecause we\'ve seen the tv ads for deep impact , ads that feature freeman telling the nation that \" the comet is still headed right for us \" and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading . \nladies and gentlemen , that is the movie . \nsuccessful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow , but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30-second tv spots . \ntelevision is what\'s wrong with deep impact . \nthe main character , played by tea leoni , is a low-level broadcast journalist for msnbc ( and that\'s the mere tip of the product-placement iceberg ) who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy . \nshe thinks it\'s an instance of an ex-secretary of something or other ( james cromwell ) resigning because of a mistress , and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area . \nwhen she goes nosing around cromwell , he begs her to keep it under wraps . \n \" i know you\'re just a reporter , but you used to be a human being . \" \nshe figures out what\'s really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search , where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction- level comet . \nupon a top-secret meeting with president freeman , leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference , at which she gets to ask the first question . \nand everyone knows , if you get to ask the first question , baby you\'re a star . \nleoni ends up in the anchor chair , broadcasting every step of the comet\'s collision course with earth . \nand i\'m sure it\'s comforting for her to know that , even though the world\'s ending in a matter of months , she\'s a cable news personality . \nso there she is , narrating the six-astronaut mission to blow the comet up . \nsuch personalities as robert duvall , jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged-out process . \nbut as anyone who\'s seen the commercials knows , the astronauts fail . \nthey only end up breaking the comet into two pieces , which means even more destruction to the earth . \nyeah , thanks , nasa . \nthat\'s when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who aren\'t picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years . \nthey even have animals , two by two , ready to climb into the cave . \nif the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed , deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie . \ninstead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife , while people pack the highways out of town . \nthe reasoning is , of course , that if a comet is going to strike , they might as well be out in some scenic rural location . \nand , amusingly , the highway is spotted with people in u-haul trucks . \ni\'m sure it\'s comforting to know that , even though the world\'s ending in a matter of minutes , the u-haul people are doing the most business of their lives . \n',neg
' \" there will be another , \" the ads for this sequel proclaimed , and why not ? \ntrue , brandon lee is dead , but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994\'s the crow , anyway . \nthe idea of spinning artist james o\'barr\'s original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie , taking its own righteous vengeance against the world . \ngiven that basic framework , the story could move in any number of directions . \nof course , it doesn\'t . \nstubbornly , the crow : city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film , when lee\'s eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death . \ni remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality . \nin flashback , we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover , and then we watch in real-time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind . \nit\'s loud and repetitive , true , a sadist\'s delight -- but it\'s also horrifying and fascinating . \ncity of angels gives us more of the same , but less skillfully . \nthere\'s an audience guaranteed for a film like this , although bad reviews and poor word-of-mouth will likely ensure that it won\'t be much of a success . \nin fact , miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings . \n ( i\'ve never understood the reasoning behind this tactic , since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow . ) \nso much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup . \nthis time , ashe ( french-accented actor vincent perez ) is retrieved from his watery death ( he and his young son were shackled together , shot , and then thrown off a pier ) by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead . \nperez might have some screen presence if he\'s given something to do with himself , but here he\'s simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face . \nat first , he\'s shivery and frightened , but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave . \nhe\'s befriended by sarah ( mia kirshner ) , presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film . \nkirshner , so beguiling in exotica , is here an exquisitely photographed blank . \ntattooed with angels\' wings , sarah is just about as lovely as women come , but she serves no purpose , not even as seductress . \nthe gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah ( richard brooks ) , but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop , who plays a gaunt fellow named curve . \niggy , all bones , veins , and drawl , is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film . \nlike all good things here , he\'s dispatched too soon and without much imagination . \nin the meantime , we\'re subjected to tedious glimpses of judah\'s compound , where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s&m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren\'t distinctly secondhand . \neven the soundtrack is tired . \nmore than anything i\'ve seen from hollywood lately , city of angels smacks baldly of product -- it\'s a movie with a lousy script but a great look . \ncritics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope , but his work isn\'t that bad per se . \nhe\'s got a good eye , and some intriguing visual ideas -- if anything , this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery . \nhis major stylistic failing is that he can\'t seem to direct an action scene , and the quick , nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie . \nbut as director , he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn\'t , the performers who couldn\'t , and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved . \nwho bought david s . goyer\'s anemic script , anyway ? \nthe producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash , or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference . \n',neg
'late in down to you , the lead female character ( julia stiles ) states her greatest fear is having an \" artificial conversation \" with her boyfriend ( freddie prinze jr . ) . \nthe irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out , fallen asleep , or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy . \nthe film is a multi-million dollar testament to everything artificial . \nfilled with characters , motivation , plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster . \nprinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles\' freshman co-ed . \nat first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out-doing the previous in how \" cute \" it can be . \nthe happy couple \" psychoanalyze \" each other ; they pick out a song because , as prinze\'s dj mother ( lucie arnez ) explains , every couple needs a song ; he smells her shampoo ; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love . \nthen , in standard romantic comedy style , things fall apart . \nwhy ? \nwell , because they have to . \notherwise the couple can\'t make up and live ( presumably ) happily ever after . \ndown to you exists outside the realm of normal logic . \nscenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism , but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead . \na picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre , not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together , or even knowing each other , but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat . \nthe supporting characters are remarkably flat , and insultingly ridiculous as well . \nstiles\' best friend ( rosario dawson ) is a pot head , prinze\'s roommate ( shawn hatosy ) is a girl crazy fool who can\'t meet women , and then there are the porn stars ( zak orth and selma blair ) . \nhe is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television , does the college lecture circuit , and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film . \nyou know , the average porn star . \nthe costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he\'s on screen , the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes . \nshe is a porn star mostly so we know she\'s slutty , so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted . \nattempts at drama ( which means julia is going to cry ) include a pregnancy scare and the big break up . \nthese characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes . \nwhat happened here ? \nthe cast is full of likable , promising , young actors ( stiles especially seems to be going places ) . \nwriter/director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off . \nin fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year\'s extremely unpleasant the story of us , for teen audiences . \nthe direction is film-school-grad obvious . \nit\'s stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen , a pointless parody of \" cops , \" characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters , and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion . \nplus , the whole story is told flashback style , narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera . \nthis is the second film in a row ( following wing commander ) starring freddie prinze jr . which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she\'s all that . \nif he doesn\'t start making better choices fast his future films won\'t be so lucky . \n',neg

'it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable . \nthe academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed . \nit also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers , james horner . \nwhat i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995 . \nwhat drags braveheart down is its screenplay . \nit abounds with high production values : john toll\'s award-winning cinematography ( which also graced edward zwick\'s 1994 legends of the fall ) , a gorgeous score by horner , and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names . \nbut this does not save a misguided script . \nthe film wishes to paint its central character as a hero , but the viewer\'s only response to his \" heroism \" is intellectual : william wallace ( producer-director mel gibson ) is fighting for freedom and against tyranny , so we have to root for him . \nbut wallace\'s actions paint a different story . \nhe speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance . \nthough one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side , the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait , in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king . \nwallace speaks of freedom , but his acts point toward vengeance . \nafter kicking the english out of scotland , he decides to invade england . \nthis is evident of a \" spartacus complex \" , and this example applies both historically and cinematically . \nthe historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities ; the film spartacus , like braveheart , has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay . \nit is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film . \nhorner\'s score tries to make emotional connection , but the performances and the script do not help . \ngibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him . \nthis drags down any emotional connection to the film\'s plot , and turns three hours into a total waste of time . \n',neg

' \" virus \" is the type of cliched , vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it . \nstrangely enough , on the same mid-january weekend last year , another film was released like this , \" deep rising , \" about an ugly monster on a cruise liner . \nprior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989\'s \" leviathan , \" 1989\'s \" deep star six , \" and all four \" alien \" pictures . \n \" virus , \" in comparison , is a servicable thriller , well-made and produced , but since it doesn\'t include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence , it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on . \nbased on a series of comic books , \" virus \" concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat , which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon . \nafter discovering that the boat is slowly sinking , ( un ) lucky for them , a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen . \nonce the team reaches the russian ship , they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted . \nafter turning the power back on , however , there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship , and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself . \none survivor finally does turn up , nadia ( joanna pacula ) , who informs the suicidal and stern captain ( donald sutherland ) and one of the crew , kit foster ( jamie lee curtis ) , that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship , taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out . \nif \" virus \" sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies , you\'re correct . \nalthough the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life , the film itself doesn\'t appear to have a brain in its head . \nthe film sticks so close to the worn-out conventions of the \" creature \" genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film . \nthe actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past , but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play . \nin her second return to horror in the last year , jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine , but that is about it . \nalthough 1998\'s \" halloween : h20 \" was also a disappointment , at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character , unlike here . \ndonald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films , such as 1994\'s \" the puppet masters , \" although i just watched him in the superb 1978 sci-fi classic \" invasion of the body snatchers , \" where he was fabulous . \nthe last of the three top-billers is william baldwin , but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture , since he has nothing to do . \nbasically , \" virus \" is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space ship/ocean liner/haunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one-by-one . \nit is not the worst of its type , but it is far from one of the best , and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this ? \nas long as some of them keep making money , i suspect the answer is never . \n',neg
'over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind\'s nuclear testing . \npartly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo . \na year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr . \nas godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world . \nthirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985 . \nnow it\'s 14 years after toho\'s remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run . \nin emmerich\'s godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr . niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms . \nwhen the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states . \nmeanwhile , tatopoulos\'s college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big-time news reporter . \nshe\'d like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break . \nof course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor \" animal \" palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey\'s trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place . \ntogether they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla . \nwith the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation\'s premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla . \nhe didn\'t . \nright up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history . \nthe plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it\'s up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down . \nthe script , however , is painfully bad . \nit\'s fraught with lines so corny , they don\'t even belong in b-movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , \" you idiot , \" or \" you stupid girl . \" \ni suppose when you\'ve got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well . \nwhy is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ?

\nokay , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky , but hey , i was on a roll . \nbroderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he\'s weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way . \nhank azaria does what he can , but don\'t expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage . \nlike broderick\'s , azaria\'s character is quite simply lacking in color . \nwhat really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting . \ncasting must have been asleep on this one . \nthe one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we\'ve seem him do in the past . \nalthough his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable . \nunfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities . \nthe entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it . \nthis results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess . \nmost of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously . \nalthough emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ? \nif we can\'t take the characters seriously , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don\'t care what happens to them . \ngodzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light-hearted than it should be . \nfar be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters , but here\'s a behemoth running through the city ! \nthere\'s bound to be a lot of casualties , but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after-school g . i . \njoe cartoon syndrome , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm\'s way just in time . \nin a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire . \nnone of the characters even remark upon this ability , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers . \nit\'s as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes , godzilla can do this , just like in the old movie . \nconsider another punch pulled . \nthrough creative script writing , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie , but the final scene in this one doesn\'t just leave the door open , it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently . \nit made me want to gag . \nemmerich should have done away with 90\% of the humor and in-jokes and played this one as a straight action film . \nwith an intelligently written screenplay , godzilla could have been so much more . \nhowever , by confusing the viewer with a ton of add-ins and parodies , the movie ends up being something that just doesn\'t work . \nnow if they only had raymond burr . . . . \n',neg
'before the remake of psycho appears , we\'ve got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film , dial m for murder . \nas usual , hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars , and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing . \nthe film opens with emily ( paltrow ) and david ( viggo mortensen ) \'having fun\' in an loft apartment . \nthe problem is , paltrow is married to stephen ( douglas ) , who is not too happy when he discovers this affair . \nif i was paltrow , though , i\'d definitely go with mortensen . \nless wrinkles . \nanyhow , stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition : he\'ll pay him to kill his lovely wife . \nmortensen agrees , but the murder goes awry , and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses . \nunfortunately , the film dosen\'t progress very fast . \nin fact , it moves like a tortoise with arthritis ( read : very , very s-l-o-w . ) \nthe plot moves nowhere fast , and only becomes exciting in very short bursts . \nnot too good for a \'thriller . \' \nalso , the performances , apart from douglas , are below par . \npaltrow , showing immense talent in se7en ( 1995 ) and sliding doors ( 1997 ) is strangely stilted , even unconvincing , in this movie . \nmortensen is a little bit better , coming across as a younger douglas , but his role isn\'t meaty enough to show all his talent . \nwhich leaves douglas to waltz away with the film , which is does . \nhowever , i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking , drinking womanizer with a creepy underside . \nalso popping up in the film is david suchet , playing a shifty looking detective . \nagain , it\'s not a character we\'re seeing on the screen , it\'s david suchet . \nthe director , who bought us the fugitive , piles on all the flash techniques , such as zoom-in\'s , quick cuts , etc . the lighting is also interesting . \nhowever , looks can\'t save this film from the depths of mediocre , and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway . \nthe screenplay is o . k , but there\'s some hackneyed sub-plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street ( again ) and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched . \nthe characters also make incredibly dumb moves , especially paltrow , and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel . \nwith a combination of no tension , drama , or decent characters , a perfect murder is a failure all round , and an incredible disappointment . \nthere are a few bright moments , but they are far and few between . \nthe last thing a thriller should be is boring , and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas , you wouldn\'t be missing anything if you decided not to watch a perfect murder . \noverall rating= \nreview by david wilcock ? 1998 \n \" you know , for kids \" - norville barnes \n',neg
'coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers , relentless , 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz , played by character actor leo rossi , spawned three more sequels . \nrelentless 3 , third in the row , features sam dietz again , but this time detective , who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case , doesn\'t want to deal with similar line of work . \ndivorced , demoralised and transferred , he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer , and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz\'s old cases . \nto make things even more interesting , it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation . \nfans of the british tv films and mini-series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies . \nthey both feature vicious psychopathic killers , yet also give a lot of , usually depressive , details about chief investigator\'s private lives . \nthis one isn\'t an exception , but similarities with british television are only in content . \nthe execution and style is different , which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best . \nuseless , gratuitous erotica also doesn\'t help either , obviously making this film longer than it should be . \nthe actors are good , though - leo rossi is fine as usual , and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career . \nsigny coleman as dietz\'s love interest , is , on the other hand , quite miscast . \nbut she won\'t have to worry about it in the future career , since relentless 3 wasn\'t supposed to be anybody\'s finest moment anyway . \n',neg

'i don\'t expect much from eddie murphy these days . \nfor the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another . \nsuch films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures . \nthe biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps . \nthe klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places . \nsherman has just invented a new \" youth drink \" that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time . \njanet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) . \nwith love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers . \nwith some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the \" buddy love \" link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker . \nbut one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated . . . \nbecause every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy . \nthen the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes . \nand did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ? \nthe movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene . \npure and simple , the klumps is a failure . \nits script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes . \nany sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process . \nit\'s more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash . \nhey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes . \nthe characterization of sherman\'s family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema . \neveryone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough . \nthe grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts . \nthe father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings . \nthe mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone . \nthe brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood . \nsherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to . \nbut the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy . \nthe family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct . \nand you got the feeling that these crass people couldn\'t act like this all the time . \nthe sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic . \nafter a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story . \nits also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line . \neven the best effects can\'t seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days . \nnow that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make . \npeople will be lined up around the block for it . \nthe studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 . \neddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he\'ll play every character in the movie . \ni just can\'t wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself . \n',neg
'brian de palma , the director who bought us carrie , dressed to kill and mission : impossible is back , and has bought all his technical expertise with him . \nsadly , he forget to bring a good story and believable characters . \nnic cage plays rick santaro , a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne ( sinise . ) \nan assassination takes place , and santaro tries to peace together how it took place , trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy . \nthe film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together . \nhowever , the film doesn\'t keep the mystery for long , and once the big \'secret\' is out concerning kevin dunne , the film is at a dead end . \nalthough there are some fantastic shots by de palma , including a 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film , halfway through the film drops dead . \nthe problem is that de palma doesn\'t have a strong story or characters to work with . \nhe tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques , but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience , and i quickly got bored . \nnic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters , but it\'s no use . \nthey are boring , faceless , and completely unlikeable . \nyes , another problem with the film is that there\'s no-one to root for . \nwe\'re supposed to be on cage\'s side , because his character becomes nicer throughout the film . \nhowever , his change is sadly unbelievable . \npoor gary sinise\'s character is terrible , who completely changes throughout the start , the middle and the end , in an appalling way . \nthe film\'s use of flashback quickly gets boring . \nwhile clever and interesting the first few times , it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go . \nthey certainly don\'t increase the tension or suspense of the movie . \nthere is small thread of suspense running through the film , but it certainly doesn\'t make this film a powerhouse thriller , rather just a slightly below average one . \nthe script is lousy and contrived , the characters flat and two dimensional . \ncertainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller . \nthe most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential . \nthere\'s a good story buried in snake eyes , it\'s just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks . \nit also gives itself away far too quickly , rather than leaving the big twist for the end . \nwhile the performances are intriguing , especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy \'number cruncher\' wrapped up in the case , there\'s no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is a terminal case of style of substance , and unless you\'re a big fan of either cage or flash directing , should be avoided . \na david wilcock review ? 1998 \n \" you know , for kids \" - norville barnes \n',neg

'lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4 : episode 1 is a boring , empty spectacle that features some nice special effects . \nafter the familiar \'a long time ago . . . . \' \nopening , the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game . \nthe plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo , ruled by queen amidala ( portman ) jedi knights qui-gon ( neeson ) and obi wan ( mcgregor ) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade . \nhowever , this simple blockade is not all it seems , and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers , including facing the evil darth maul ( ray park . ) \nthey also meet the future darth vadar , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) \nstar wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking : script , direction and characters . \nthe script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic . \nthe trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star , and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non-existent . \nthere\'s no underlying tension , and no urgent need to see what the outcome is . \nthe film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story , which doesn\'t help . \nthere\'s no snap to make the film work , it moves at a plod . \nthe script is boring : all the characters speak in morals , especially anakins mother . \nthere\'s no group spirit evident here , and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders , it\'s evident that not much is going to happen . \nthe two leads are hideously boring , static characters given little to do and too much time to do it . \nqui-gon and obi-wan hold no presence on film , and give little for the audience to root for . \nthe audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul , if he had been given more screen time . \nmaul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history , even if he does provide the only \'straight\' plot line in the film ( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy . ) \nanakin is annoying and unlikeable . , \ninstead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended . \nit\'s probably not surprising that his hateful little boy , unfortunately blessed \'ani\' by everyone he knows , joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible . \nthe comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks , although in the end none is provided in the film by him . \nalthough his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys , the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny . \nthe only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a \'pod\' racer , because i knew he wouldn\'t be able to talk for a while . \nqueen amidala is a nothing in the film , she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must \'serve her people , \' and go goo-goo over anakin . \nagain , her role will become more important in the later episodes , and is given little to do here . \nthe actors don\'t help the movie much either . \nliam neeson seems bored and embarrassed , and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible . \nmcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy , with little charm . \nthe casting director must have chose him because he\'s scottish like alec guinness : there\'s little other explanation for it . \nnatalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script , but she delivers a spunky performance . \nand jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice . \nthere\'s very little talent evident with him , it\'s hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there . \nhe\'s not even very \'cute . \' \nthe main claim of the film , the special effects , are okay . \nthere\'s nothing impressive about them , yet they complement the story well . \nthe cgi takes away much of the human element , however . \nthe battle droids for example , the replacement for the stormtroopers , are characterless little computer graphics , lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers . \nepisode 1 is just disappointing . \nit\'s got high production values , but little else . \nthe music is meandering , except near the end . \nthe plot gives us no-one to root for , or even care for . \nthe effects are nice , but dull . \nthe plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should . \nthere\'s an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair , and many clich ? s are catered for throughout the film . \napart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence , episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose , except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film . \ndisappointing is barely the word . \nrating= \n',neg

'tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . \nthe film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it\'s evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . \nenduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . \nthe qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . \ntectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . \nit\'s not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , \" look ! \nart ! \" ) , \nalthough it keeps the audience distanced from the characters . \nbecause we\'re constantly made aware that we\'re watching a play or a movie , it\'s impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer\'s ideas . \nthey\'re not real , sympathetic , or believable . \ni\'m willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success . \ntectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) . \none day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself . \nwhile preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision . \nmeanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host . \nwith settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else . \nhowever , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers . \nthe tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn\'t take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious . \ntectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point . \nthere are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren\'t bilingual ) . \nthe only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it\'s different , ( b ) it\'s not like anything they\'ve seen before , and ( c ) it\'s pretentious . \nfor everyone else , it\'s not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage . \n',neg
'various films seen at the seattle film festival : \nit\'s all true/three men on a raft ( u . s . a . , 1942/1986 ) director : orson welles \na recently uncovered one-fourth of orson welle\'s planned \" docu-drama \" of amazing stories around the world named it\'s all true , this short dealt with welle\'s attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft . \nwhile several clips of the film are seen , the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle\'s attempts to film it , despite studio problems , a staggering workload , and extremely ill fortune on the set . \nimpressive photography , but really only interesting to film historians . \nsadie thompson ( u . s . a . , 1928 ) director : raoul walsh screenwriter : raoul walsh , from the john colton play \" rain \" , based on w . somerset maugham\'s story \" miss thompson \" cast : gloria swanson , raoul walsh , lionel barrymore silent \nafter the discussion of the newly-restored version of frank capra\'s lost horizon , where several scenes had been restored using stills , i was interested to see sadie thompson , where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago . \nthis is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story \" miss thompson \" . \nthis is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen--little awkwardness , and a very clever script . \nthe actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie\'s soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel . \nswanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie . \nunfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live-action film , or the original script . \nthe happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i cannot believe maugham\'s short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we\'ve been waiting an hour and a half for . \nstill , it\'s entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore\'s incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells , bakkers , and robertses of the religious worlds . \na c movie ; worth 2 . 50 if you can find it . \nthe pied piper ( czechoslovakia , 1986 ) director : jim barta screenwriter : kamil piza \nthis is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids . \nit tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate , and with a lot of political comment along with it . \nperhaps economic content is a better word--it certainly doesn\'t show capitalism in a good light . \nnor human nature , nor anything else , for that matter . \nas you may have guessed , this is not a tgif film ; this is the kind of film you are glad is over . \nnot that it wasn\'t interesting for technical reasons ; this is stop-animation that is very well done . \nall the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts--except for the animated stuffed rats . \nboy , sounds like a real comedy vehicle , doesn\'t it ? \nadd onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison , and you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night . \nsome gore . \ndon\'t bring children to this one . \ndon\'t bring adults to this one , unless they\'re fascinated by puppetry and/or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped . \nblech . \n . no fun whatsoever . \nmeier ( west germany , 1986 ) director/screenwriter : peter timm cast : rainier grenkowitz , nadja engelbrecht , alexander hauff , thomas besvater sub-titled \nthis film takes us back and forth over the east german/west german border with meier , an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money . \nhis uncle ( also in the west ) sneaks meier out of the country , unknown to the east germans . \nmeier , however , is less than thrilled-- his girlfriend , his friends and his job ( which he likes ) all exist in east germany . \nafter a round-the-world trip ( his boss think\'s he\'s on leave in bulgaria ) , meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id , and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew\'s work--while everyone think\'s he\'s still living in east germany . \nof course , something goes wrong--and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there . \nthe humor is spread too thin , and much of the plot is too obvious ( as is the acting ) . \nstill , a good concept for the comedy , and the last five minutes are pretty funny . \nc -- $2 . 50 . \nthe right hand man ( australia , 1986 ) director : di drew screenplay : helen hodgman cast : rupert everett , hugo weaving , arthur dignam , jennifer claire , catherine mcclements \nafter a lifetime of movie-going , and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival , i\'ve learned several rules which , while not absolute , should certainly be given deference to : \n1 ) be wary of french comedies . \nthese people like jerry lewis . \n2 ) ken russell is never going to grow up , no matter how long you wait . \n3 ) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as \" old pouty-lips \" is probably not worth watching . \n4 ) when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography , watch out ! \naustralia has good cinematographers up the whazoo , but since weir and miller left for foreign shores , finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult ( not impossible--witness malcolm last year ) task . \nwell , i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night , and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards . \nit\'s as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30\'s about tragedy among the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses . \nlots and lots of horses . \nthe film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship , which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing , because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir . \nunfortunately , said son , a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times , kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident . \nhighlights include the amputation sequence ; the doctor\'s daughter , who has the hots for the son , tasting his urine for a diagnosis ; their tender kissing with a window between them ( while it\'s raining--you\'d think a woman studying medicine would know better ) . \nthe photography is good , but i kept wishing for b&w--everything seems sepia-colored anyway . \nactually , i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead , but that\'s life . \ngrade : z . avoid like the plague , unless you\'re looking for inadvertent yuks . \n',neg
'capsule : the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies , dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension . \nalien 3 ( the \" 3 \" should be in superscript ) is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen . \nit continues the story of ripley , the space-trucker-turned-impromptu-survivalist , but seems remarkably uninterested in her . \nin fact , the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all , it\'s so elegaic and limp . \na little of this would have been nice for atmosphere , but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning . \nat the end of the last film ( aliens ) , ripley and two survivors were on their way home . \nunfortunately , an alien pod had been deposited in their ship , and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod . \nthe pod crashes on firorina 161 , a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent . \nripley lives through the crash ; the others do not . \nthe prison is a grim place , even as prisons go -- it\'s been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks , which provides no end of techno-gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against . \nlice are endemic , and so ripley\'s head is shaved ( another surreal touch ) . \nat first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive , but it doesn\'t stay that way . \none of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches , and soon a newly-gestated alien is running amuck . \nworse , it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated . \nwhat\'s weird is how little tension this generates , except near the end , when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable : loud music , shaky camerawork , etc . sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role , and she does well with it , but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack . \nthe supporting actors are also not given a lot to do : the doctor ( charles dance ) and another , rather religious inmate ( charles s . dutton , very good ) , hiave presence , but they\'re not asked to do anything with it . \nin light of the impending sequel , which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie , i will not talk about the ending -- except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie . \nit\'s strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn\'t have driven the rest of it . \n',neg
' \" from the director of \" the nightmare before christmas \" it said in the previews , which i\'m guessing was said to get people to go see the movie , obviously it hasn\'t worked since the $75 million dollar movie has yet to break $5 million . \nto each it\'s own however , since \" monkey bone \" is not only a bad movie all together , but technically well-made . \na tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects . \nstu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena \" monkey bone \" a crude comic strip , that everyone wants to merchandise , they go to great links to get it as well , including dollars that let out fart powder . \nwhen stu and his girlfriend , julie ( bridget fonda ) are in a freak car accident ( you\'ll see ) stu goes into a coma , and while in his coma stu travels to i\'m guessing dark town , where all the characters in dreams come to life . \npeople are stuck in this town , with their nightmares roaming around them . \nwhen stu spots monkey bone ( whom he really can\'t stand ) he tries to keep him under control . \nmaking a new friend kitty ( rose mcgowan ) he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death , he can go back up and live his life . \nwhen monkey bone and stu steal a pass , monkey bone becomes a trader and takes it and goes into stu\'s body . \nnow monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder , so everyone has nightmares . . . or \nsomething like that . \nrather complex ( in fact more than it needs to be ) \" monkey bone \" had potential in the script and even the story . \nwhat is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes , and lack of character development . \nfor instance we really don\'t get to know who stu or julie are , so why should we even care ? \nkitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her , but we are not given a chance to know her . \nthe cast is decent however , brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley , but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body . \nbridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to a screeching halt , her performance is bad and she seems miscast . \ndave foley isn\'t given enough to do , as well as \" will & grace\'s \" megan mullally who can be funny . \nthe standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself , he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being a total bust . \nthe special effects of \" monkey bone \" is what might really bring in some curious viewers , these special effects are highly effective , and nice to look at with the eyes . \nsome of them are believable and some unbelievable . . . for \nmonkey bone he seems to be like stuart little , you really don\'t realize that he is animated . . . but \non occasion it sneaks up on you . \nthe direction by henry selick is good , but at times he doesn\'t know what kind of film he wants to make , and the ending climax falls off the cliff . \nit\'s too bad really , \" monkey bone \" could have been a real good movie , but with it\'s heavily done hack job , and lack of character development it just sinks when the end credits role . \nfor those curious however , it might be worth the rental , but other than that avoid this one . \n',neg

) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country . \neverything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . \nthe film\'s mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . \nthere has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . \nthe film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide . \nthe widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined . \nhe left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage . \nthe widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband\'s enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless . \nshe also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) . \nwhat makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her . \neven though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures . \nher gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . \nsince she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use . \nthe two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff . \nfor grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) . \nthe locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace\'s greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can\'t control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation . \nthe story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn\'t want matthew to end up in jail . \nit is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . \nthe scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity . \nthe film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity . \nthings work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . \nthere are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . \nthis \'unhip\' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute . \nummm !

' \" love to kill \" starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes . \nat the outset , the movie appears to be about tony danza , who\'s an illegal distributor of guns , trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman . \ndanza sets up a double date with her , her sister , and a collegue of his . \neverything seems to be going well , until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs . \nmuch confusion and mahem ensues , as the death is covered up and other associates of danza\'s begin to emerge , all after one thing or another . \nsound confusing ? \nit is . \ni think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity . \nin some respects , it works . \nbut the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess . \ncharacters keep popping up with no explanation , demanding money for deals that occur off-screen . \nthe only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead woman\'s sister . \nbut so little time is devoted to this part of the story , we never really become too familiar with these characters , and because of this , we don\'t really care what happens to them . \nwell , i didn\'t , at least . \none thing i will give the movie is that it\'s a complete departure for tony danza . \nhere\'s a guy , because of his many sitcom roles , who\'s ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing . \nhere , he plays a man who\'s just looking out for himself , and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin , so be it . \ni was very impressed by his performance , and within minutes of the start of the film , i had forgotten all about his good-guy persona . \nmichael madsen is also good as an associate of danza\'s who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him . \nlike i said , it\'s not exactly a linear storyline . \n \" love to kill \" should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre , but it\'s just too bad that the story doesn\'t really add up to much . \nthe stars deserved better , and so did the audience . \n',neg

'in 1912 , a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america . \nthis ship was built to be the largest ship in the world , and she was . \nshe was also build to be one of the most luxurious , and that she was . \nfinally , she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not . \nto get a ticket for this voyage you either : spent a life\'s savings to get to america to start life anew , were part of the upper class and had the money to spare , or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson . \njack dawson makes the trip , and happens to be at the right place at the right time . \nrose dewitt bukater , a first class passenger , climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping . \nthus is started a tale of romance and intrigue , and a tale of death and tragedy . . . \nthis movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago , an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia . \nthe movie titanic shows what happened , maybe not with a 100\% degree of accuracy , but it still shows it very realisticaly . \nnow the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story . \nit serves as both admirably , brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating . \nthis movie is very emotional simply because of what it is , but that alone is not enough . \nthe story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective . \nmovies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency . \nthe attention to detail that was paid is remarkable . \nthe whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting , with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie . \npart of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting , and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast . \nthe performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired . \nthe characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles . \nlooking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren\'t acting but are actually the characters in the movie . \nthe casting for the movie could really have been better , in my humble opinion that is . \none character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself . \nyes , you read correctly , the ship is a character . \nhow is the titanic a character ? \nyou ask well simple , a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you . \nthis character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this . \nmr . cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense . \nall this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp . \nnow , to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards . \nthe effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking . \nin some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there , you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening ( if your imagination is good ) . \nthe technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique . \nthe movie will leave you amazed at the effects , and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie , just humans and an oversized ship . \nthe movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions , the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes . \nnow that is not a feat accomplished by most movies , now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch , i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end . \nthe historical value of this movie is quite high , and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy , for it is extremely well done . \nthe method of telling the story is also good , maybe not totally unique but effective none the less . \nregardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at . \nthe simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing . \nif you get the chance to see this movie go ! ! ! \nit might not be the best movie in the world . . \nbut it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it . \nduring none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie . \n',pos

'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \njames toback\'s return to directing after a eight-year layoff , two girls and a guy , is a film which is comprised , more or less , of just that : one guy , blake ( robert downey jr . ) ; two girls , carla ( heather graham ) and lou ( natasha gregson wagner ) ; one primary setting ( blake\'s absurdly spacious bachelor apartment ) , and a great deal of dialogue . \nembracing a near real-time approach , this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr . toback for his bantering characters . \nfortunately , the film\'s cast is up to the challenge , and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters , while admittedly variable , are occasionally wickedly amusing . \nthe film\'s setup is fairly generic in nature , and opens rather unpromisingly . \nwe meet self-possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou , both waiting outside a soho loft . \nas they engage in idle chatter , it is revealed that they\'re both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport , and it doesn\'t take long for them to come to the realisation that they\'re being two-timed by the same guy . \nmore indignant with him than catty with each other , the duo break into blake\'s loft and await his arrival for a confrontation . \nit\'s when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride . \nplayed with magnificent bombast by mr . downey jr . , blake is a cad , all right , but a captivatingly dynamic , blusterous , and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights . \nit\'s fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat , and perhaps the film\'s best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return , allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others , but by his own innate behaviour . \nwhether he\'s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi , or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds ( carla , lou , and his unseen sickly mother ) , it\'s never less than wildly entertaining and insightful . \nthough at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one-man show -- a typical afternoon in the life of blake , if you will -- carla , and then lou , reveal themselves , and the sparks begin to fly . \n ( one of the great touches in the film is how blake , when startled by carla\'s unannounced appearance , begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat\'s out of the bag . ) \ndouble-teamed by the understandably aggrieved women ( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful -- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy ) , an increasingly-flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self-righteous declarations against their verbal jabs . \nsurprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters , two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off-limits for this film . \nhowever , it\'d be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou\'s outrage to full feature-length , and it\'s as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel . \nthe dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever , the film\'s tempo loses its liveliness , the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion , and several sequences fall flat . \nsubtle and not-quite-subtle allusions are made ( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall ) , and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale . \none key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla . \ntwo girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter , long-running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene -- contractually-obligated to deliver an r-rated film , mr . toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled-down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc-17 rating in favour of an r -- and while admittedly titillating , the net effect of the vignette on the film\'s thematic narrative is rather dubious . \nif anything , two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr . downey jr . , whose versatility is put to the test in this film . \nhe plays the gamut from indignant to humbled , from self-assured to disconcerted , yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered . \nit\'s a wonderful performance in a role custom-tailored for him ; mr . toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr . downey jr . was arrested on drug charges , and it\'s hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character -- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection , blake\'s self-chiding to \" get [his] shit together \" is disquieting in its resonance . \nwhile mr . downey jr . \'s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film , both actresses are solid in more broadly-observed roles . \nms . graham is quickly becoming one of america\'s more daring actresses , involving herself in three successive risky projects -- two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank , while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman . \nshe\'s quite appealing here , playing a character at once both dainty and sultry . \nmeanwhile , ms . gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying , or , like me , endearing . \nshe tones it down substantially as the film progresses , but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox . \nthe film was reportedly shot in eleven days , filmed mostly in sequence , and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout . \ntwo girls and a guy has an agile , spontaneous sort of feel , and one senses that mr . toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors . \nwhile the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact , it doesn\'t feel constricted ; the expansive apartment setting is well-used to vary the background , and mr . toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner . \ntwo girls and a guy falls short of its potential , but thanks to some stellar work by mr . downey jr . , it\'s still often an enjoyable , bitingly funny romp , particularly as we watch the surprisingly-resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends . \n \" i\'m an actor , \" he tells them at one point , using the ol\' tried-and-tested occupational-hazard defense . \n \" actors lie . \" \nbut not , they all seem to agree , denzel washington . \n',pos
'robert altman\'s cookie\'s fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good . \nit is a sunny , delightful , dreamy comedy , filled with lovely performances , skillful direction and topped off with an understated , clever , extraordinary script . \nas this is an ensemble piece , it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters , all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs . \nfirst we meet willie ( charles s . dutton ) , an honest man with a slight drinking habit . \nwe then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie , who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness , despair , and want of her dead husband . \nwe cut to camille ( glenn close ) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora ( julianne moore ) . \nthen we briefly get acquainted with emma ( liv tyler ) , an apparent relative of cookie , who is a down-but-not-out teen outcast , still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live . \nwe also fleetingly see emma\'s lover jason ( chris o\'donnell ) , an ambitious but far too excitable young cop . \nwe are now about one quarter through the two hour picture , and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion . \nwe see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband . \nshe exclaims \" here i come ! \" \nand then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself . \nsoon after , her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl , comes upstairs , finds cookie dead and flips out . \nconvinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family , she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow ( yet sweet ) sister that it was a murder . \nshe makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well ; scattering jewelry all over the floor , breaking a few cabinets , windows and doors , and then throwing the gun out in the back yard . \nthe only reasonable suspect is willie , who immediately gets taken into custody , and put in a jail cell ( they all know he didn\'t do it , so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma ) . \nmeanwhile , the unperturbed camille continues her none-too-subtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success . \nso begins cookie\'s fortune , a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as \" a southern spin on fargo , \" except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers\' darker , somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade . \nrobert altman\'s slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well , in that both films focus ( on and off ) on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town . \nindeed , most of the characters in cookie\'s fortune are loads of fun to observe , and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi- dimensional . \nglenn close turns in an insubstantial ( in terms of her career ) but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie , and she is perfectly cast as the prolific \" aunt alexandria \" character , endlessly obsessed with family dignity . \nthe equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s . dutton ( mimic , a time to kill ) \nthere is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours , even days after the film ends . \ncookie\'s fortune is such a movie . \ni loved the light , kindhearted approach altman ( whose last project was the dark , intense drama the gingerbread man ) took towards the tricky subject matter . \ni enjoyed the talented ensemble cast . \ni even liked the trite \" in the south everybody is related to everybody \" cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close . \ni\'m not sure why cookie\'s fortune had such an all-around pleasing effect on me . \nperhaps it\'s that good ol\' southern charm . \n',pos

'niagara niagara ( r ) bob gosse\'s niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of young-lovers-on-the-road movies . \nwild marcy ( robin tunney ) and calm seth ( henry thomas ) meet cute , literally running into each other while shoplifting at a local store . \na mere couple of scenes later , the two embark on a journey to toronto from their small , unnamed american town in pursuit of a rare doll that marcy desperately wants . \nalong the way , true love inevitably blossoms . \nwhat sets niagara niagara apart , though , is that marcy is afflicted with tourette\'s syndrome , a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle and vocal tics . \ntunney , displaying an acting range not hinted at in the teenage witch thriller the craft , delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at last year\'s venice film festival . \nto term her work a tour-de-force is not to imply that she attacks the scenery ; tunney\'s effectiveness lies in her modulation and vulnerability , which makes her depiction of marcy\'s illness--which often causes her to act violently--that much more convincing and tragic . \nshe and the nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent and beguilingly off-kilter chemistry . \ntheir journey hits a few rough spots creatively along the way , mostly the fault of writer matthew weiss . \na detour involving a kindly widower ( michael parks ) who takes the couple in brings the story to a screeching halt , and the key character of a trigger-happy pharmacist ( stephen lang ) is highly unbelievable . \nbut these missteps do not blunt the power of tunney\'s bravura turn , which carries niagara niagara to a level of poignance it would not have otherwise achieved . \n ( opens march 20 ) \n \" i didn\'t know what to expect . \nit\'s like something you chase for so long , but then you don\'t know how to react when you get it . \ni still don\'t know how to react . \" \n--michael jordan , on winning his first nba championship in 1991 . . . or , \nmy thoughts after meeting him on november 21 , 1997 \n',pos
'notice : this is a review and analysis of exotica . \nthe first part of this piece is the review , the second part contains some analysis of the movie which might be construed as spoilers . \nif you have not seen the movie and after reading the first part you intend to do so , then save the second part for the discussion afterwards . \nstarring : bruce greenwood , mia kirshner , elias kosteas , don mckellar , arsinee khanijian , sarah polley director : atom egoyan screenplay : atom egoyan \nexotica is a film that grows on retrospection . \nexotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film . \nall of the people know each other , but apart from that , there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account . \nthe director hints for possible solutions , using a multi-line plot , so popular with critics in mystery train , and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction . \nexotica reaches a whole new dimension using this technique . \nat the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together , in spite their apparent unconnectedness and even misleading features . \nthe out-of-chronological-order technique has become ever so popular , perhaps even de rigueur , for biographical films . \nsimilarly , we can now expect to see more movies in the future which will use , to varying extent , converging multiplots . \non a first glance , once the multi-plot puzzle in exotica is solved , there seems to be little left to look at . \nbut perceptive minds which take the time to dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather , commentaries on views of life . \nexotica is very much worth seeing . \nit opened to critic\'s praise worldwide ( i first saw it in mexico city , last december ) . \nin canada , it broke records for a movie of its kind , which prompted the american distributor to go for a wide release . \napart from a strong plot , acting is very convincing , and the soundtrack seems as if made for the movie . \nthe spoon-fed-entertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie , and thus it might last little on screen . \nbut if you want to try a movie a cut above the crowd , with an originality that is ever so rare , by all means see exotica . \nanalysis ( * * spoilers * * ahead ) \nwhat is behind the complex plot in exotica ? \nfirst , a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means . \nthe lone tax-auditor , the repressed homosexual pet shop owner , the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub , the rich man which has the club remodeled , the audience at the movie theatre , all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul . . . . \nthen we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people , including those who sit watching exotica . . . . \nin that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub , for the rich man looking through silver mirrors , and poor-rich people looking at other\'s people lives through a silver screen . \nexotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people , such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner . \nexotica is the customer agent looking at the pet shop owner , which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer and the tax auditor through the detached eye of a gay person ( no attraction to the strip dancer ) , and only interested on avoiding jail ( no personal relationship with the tax auditor ) . \nin exotica everybody is watching , and what is worse , everybody knows . \nsecond , exotica is about isolated people holding back their feelings ; about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality to other characters . \nthe strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter , the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relationship between the father and the proverbial daughter . \nthe niece becomes the baby sitter , the baby sitter becomes the dancer , and the dancer becomes the proverbial daughter . \nthe pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj , by finding the proverbial daughter . \na chain made of real and imagined links coming around full circle , just as everything comes around to a fitting whole at the end of the movie . \n',pos
'i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live-action-disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins , separated at birth by divorcing parents , never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again . \nand everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you\'re going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea ) . \nthis remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite . \ncontemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they\'re usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10 . \nthis one , however , is shockingly not bad . \nin fact , it\'s actually good . \nnot the original good , but what\'s great about it is that it doesn\'t necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining . \nbecause it\'s cute and innocent fun . \nbecause it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with . \nbecause the lead star is immensely appealing . \nbecause the parents are also immensely appealing . \nand ( i\'m repeating myself ) because it\'s cute and innocent fun . \nthere\'s nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it\'s aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid . \ni , personally , am somewhere between the second and third . \ni can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn\'t so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick weren\'t even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc\'s \" wonderful world of disney , \" where they\'d show you a live-action and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week . \ni can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like \" lady and the tramp \" and \" pinnochio \" ) . \nand , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children\'s animated half-hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i wouldn\'t dare missing . \ni can even remember seeing the made-for-tv \" parent trap ii \" on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original \" parent trap . \" \nit\'s more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney-ized version . \nit\'s playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i\'d probably dismiss it . \ni\'d probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn\'t seen the original at such a perfect age . \nwatching it , i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly-perfect parents splitting up , and how it affected my adolescence . \nand also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke , and pointed out that even in the most fucked-up of situations , things could always work out if you , well , manipulate things a bit , at least for the better . \nthis new version did that for me , but it\'s also charming in its own way . \nit has a new cast , a contemporary feel , and , for the first time in awhile for a live-action-disney flick , a tone that isn\'t corny or condescending , but just right . \nthe moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way . \nand for the first time since the original film , the kids actually know better than the foolish adults . \nthe story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa\'s \" the seven samurai \" : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents . \none , annie , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembling her mother , vanessa redgrave , more than i had ever noticed ) in london , where she lives with her parents and her devoted , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she works as a swingin\' fashion designer . \nshe grows up refined and classy , but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker-playing . \nthe other , hallie , is sent to northern california with her father ( dennis quaid ) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo-maid ( lisa ann walter ) , and grows up rugged yet charming . \nthey both meet at the same camp , one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged . \nthey feud because they look all-too similar , and are thus in tight competition , which results in some nasty pranks , which winds them in seclusion together in a private , out-of-the-way cabin . \nthere , they become friends , then learn about eachother . \nonce they know everything , they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent , whom they\'ve only heard of . \nthey learn about eachother\'s lives in detail , they make sure they look alike ( which requires hair cutting and , notoriously , ear-piercing - a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in \" pulp fiction \" ) , and when the end of summer comes , they switch and hope for the best . \nlindsay lohan doesn\'t necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original . \nbut she comes off just as appealing as she did once . \nshe does , though , add a couple new things : she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original , respectively . \nshe also adds on an american and british accent to each one , with one faking the other accent throughout , and if you really take notice , you can see that the fake ones\' accents aren\'t exactly perfect . \nshe\'s also incredibly appealing , not merely cute , which is especially notable since this is her first feature film , and we know how notorious child actors are , especially in their first films . \nshe makes a great protagonist , and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing . \ndennis quaid , in fact , hasn\'t been this likable in about a decade - his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past , not just that he\'s mr . meg ryan . \nditto natasha richardson ( except that she just hasn\'t ever been this likable period ) . \nthe two make a winning couple , maybe not so winning as maureen o\'hara and the late brian keith in the original , but they still work for this film . \ninstead of the bickering that ensued in the original , the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original : during the opening credits , we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2 , where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother , and when back together again , the film\'s more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental , but in that great way , not the migraine-inducing way as in many such films . \nthis all brings this new \" parent trap \" to a level of entertainment that hasn\'t really existed since , well , the original film years ago , still my money the best live-action-disney flick of all time . \nthis is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot ( a gold-digging sharon stone type , played by elaine hendrix , who\'s deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film ) a treat instead of a bore . \nlike the original , this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be ( case in point : \" it takes two \" starring the olsen twins ) because it treats the children as the smart ones , and the adults as the silly ones , not the other way around . \nand because , above everything , it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew . \nhowever , in comparison with the original , it could be a bit better . \ncertain scenes work well , but not nearly as well as they worked in the original . \ni liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine - somehow , feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing , a lesson extracted from the howard hawks/cary grant films of yesteryear . \nand as much as this film transcends mere cutedom , compared to the original , this film almost drowns in cutedom . \nthe original , though not gritty , was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences . \nas such , this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film , but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect , and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances . \n',pos
'gere , willis , poitier chase each other around the world \nthe jackal a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman \nwhen the soviet union imploded , the western countries lost their shadow . \nwith the united states friendly with the russians , we no longer had an entity to blame for the world\'s problems . \nthis showed up in hollywood films as the communist government was no longer the easy bad guy . \nit\'s time to rejoice because we\'ve found our new villain . \nnow it\'s no longer the russian government who sends killers out into foreign lands , it\'s the russian _mafia_ . \na perfect solution , it combines the dread of organized crime and the still-present uneasiness with the former eastern block countries . \nbest of all , the villains are still foreigners : fear of the other always plays best . \nso it is a crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal ( bruce willis ) to assassinate a highly placed us government figure in retaliation for the death of his brother during a nightclub raid . \nthe fbi is at a loss as to how to protect the target from someone they\'re not sure even exists . \ncoming to their rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen ( richard gere ) who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston ( sidney poitier ) and russian major valentina koslova ( diane venora ) . \nmulqueen\'s ex-girlfriend basque terrorist isabella ( mathilda may ) is the only person who has seen the elusive jackal . \n ( presumably there is an exclusive international terrorist club somewhere where the three met . ) \nthe film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his $70 million hit and mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makes sure that the irishman doesn\'t slip away . \ncrossing numerous borders and donning various disguises for both himself and his mini-van , the killer is always one step ahead of his pursuers . \nbeing very loosely based on the same book the 1973 thriller \" the day of the jackal \" , comparison between the two films is inevitable . \nthere is no doubt that the original is the better movie , playing the story for suspense rather than the current action/adventure . \nas a mystery , \" the jackal \" has enough holes in it to ruin the tale , but if you can accept it for what it is , there\'s entertainment to be had . \nholes ? let\'s see ? a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up . \nfor a 20-year veteran that can command the big bucks , the jackal is an incredibly poor shot . \nthe final scene between gere and willis occurs in a location that should be mobbed with police , but it\'s just the two of them . \nwillis\' disguises usually look like bruce willis and are just as interesting as val kilmer\'s in \" the saint \" . \n ( and lest you misunderstand , that\'s not a compliment . ) \nbut the three stars are fun to watch . \nit\'s good to see gere in something other than a business suit . \nwillis has a mixed history in picking projects , but his characters are always watchable . \npoitier is by far the superior actor , but has limited screen time . \nthe problems in logic are flaws , but don\'t ruin the experience . \noccasionally there are movies that transcend their blemishes . \nthis is one of them . \n[the appeared in the 11/20/97 \" bloomington voice \" , bloomington , indiana] \n',pos
'it\'s terribly unfortunate that \" stir of echoes , \" tautly written and directed by david koepp ( who made one of 1996\'s unsung treasures , \" the trigger effect \" ) , should be released little more than a month after \" the sixth sense , \" which is still going strong at the box office . \nthese two films are undoubtedly going to be compared ( judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night ) , and although they have eerily similar storylines , \" stir of echoes \" is more of a straightforward psychological horror film , while \" the sixth sense \" is closer to a psychological drama . \nadditionally , while \" the sixth sense \" had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business , \" stir of echoes \" is more conventional and predictable in its final twist . \nand where \" the sixth sense \" was disturbing , \" stir of echoes \" is just plain scary . \ni have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities , and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits . \nadapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago , \" stir of echoes \" opens with a cute six-year-old boy named jake ( zachary david cope ) who is taking a bath . \nhe is speaking directly at the screen , but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there . \nfinally , he asks , \" does it hurt to be dead ? \" \napparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people , but unlike \" the sixth sense , \" this young child isn\'t the focus of the picture . \ninstead , tom witzy ( kevin bacon ) , a chicago lineman , is our protagonist . \njake is his son , and maggie ( kathryn erbe ) , whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant , is his hard-working wife . \none night while at a party with their closest friends , tom convinces maggie\'s new-age sister , lisa ( illena douglas ) , to try and hypnotize him . \nit unexpectedly works , and before long , tom is seeing things he wouldn\'t normally see , including a deceased teenage girl ( jenny morrison ) in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months . \nseeking help from lisa , she tells him that , while he was under hypnosis , she told him that after he awoke , his mind will remain clear and free , like an opened door . \nshe didn\'t expect it to work , but it did , and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees . \n \" stir of echoes \" isn\'t a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination , but in the thick , atmospheric mood it conjures up , it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror-drama , and is not only effective on a technical level , but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working-class family . \nkevin bacon and , especially , kathryn erbe ( 1997\'s \" dream with the fishes \" ) , are top-notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems . \nafter tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions , he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house , and instead of maggie not being understanding , she instead believes what tom says , and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through , does not try to stop his pursuit . \nbacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts , and therefore , are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet . \nin a masterfully-done , entrancing sequence , tom is hypnotized by lisa , but instead of watching him , we instead see what he sees , starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness . \nlisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater , and so , we , as audience members , are watching a movie screen from inside a theater , which is also showing a movie screen in a theater . \ntelling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen , we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is \" sleep . \" \nnever before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly-construed as this one . \ntruthfully , this set-piece , and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt , are worth the full price of admission alone , just to see them on the big screen . \nhaving loads of fun with her small role as maggie\'s sister , lisa , illeana douglas ( 1995\'s \" to die for , \" her last great character ) is a delight , but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films . \nfunny and enjoyably offbeat , douglas gets to utter the best line in the film : while talking to maggie about tom\'s visions of the girl , she remarks , \" i wouldn\'t be worried about him seeing another girl , although the fact that she\'s dead gives one pause . \" \nalso of note are jenny morrison ( 1994\'s \" intersection \" ) , who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character , and liza weil , remarkable in 1998\'s \" whatever , \" as morrison\'s grieving teenage sister , debbie . \nif the resolution of \" stir of echoes \" does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential ( and it doesn\'t ) , what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty . \nthe music score , by james newton howard , and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects , successfully compliment and foreshadow the off-kilter frame-of-mind that tom is put into , and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically-written characters . \n \" stir of echoes \" isn\'t as good as \" the sixth sense , \" but why should it need to be ? \nboth films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet , and \" stir of echoes \" really is a spinetinglingly good horror film . \n',pos
'usually when a blockbuster comes out , it\'s loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action . \nmystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year . \nthe film is based upon the comic book series \" the flaming carrot \" by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) . \nthings go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city . \nwell , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance . \nthis is where the film takes a turn for the better . \nin the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes . \n \" blue raja ( hank azaria ) , \" mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and \" the shoveller ( william h . macy ) . \nsure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast . \nthat is until they aquire \" invisible boy \" ( kel mitchell ) , and \" the bowler \" ( janeane garafalo ) and \" mr . splein \" ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess . \nthankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen . \nthe whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest . \nfor one , the film is considerably clever . \nit literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc . in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way . \na part of the cleverness comes from the cast . \nsometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here . \nwhile azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out . \none was paul reuben . \nno matter how disgusting or revolting \" mr . splein \" may be , you still can\'t help but laugh . \nit\' so incredibly moronic , it\'s just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions . \njaneane garafalo also was an interesting character . \nshe seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing . \nmen is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes . \non the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off . \nkel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless . \ntheir parts were so limited , they\'d be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes . \nben stiller too was wasted , mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue . \nnone of these characters get a rise out of anybody , but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film . \nas far as the budget goes , it was wisely spent on the cast , not the effects . \nwhile the set designs and action all look nice , i\'m glad there was a seperate aspect , that the film focused on , and for that i applaud . \nslow at times , and rather pointless , mystery men still delivers . \nit forgets about money making , because it\'s not likely to make a bundle like it\'s proceeders , and that\'s what works . \nstupid ? \nmaybe , but for once i\'m not disappointed . \nno one expected an intelligent film , but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year . \n',pos
'review- peter jackson\'s the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in a movie , and still coming in at the extremely cheap $30 million price tag . \nbut for those who were dismayed by this year\'s blockbusters like twister and independence day , the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects . \nand for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily . \nthe frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a high-profile movie can get . \nmichael j . fox stars as frank bannister , a con artist who can speak to ghosts . \nhe uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people , then he comes and pretends to get rid of them . \nthis is how he has made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash 5 years ago . \nfrank\'s latest customers are a young couple , played by trini alvarado and peter dobson . \nwhen dobson ends up dead , alvarado starts to take an interest in fox . \nbut dobson\'s spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive he\'s dead . \nthis leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado , with dobson tagging along as a ghost . \nthings start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking place in the town . \nfox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims , but noone else can see that . \nso when fox shows up to try and save each victim , naturally people suspect he is the killer . \nfox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collector\'s hit list , and the last half hour of the movie deals with fox\'s attempts to save her from this evil spirit . \nthere are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh . \nthe movie starts off as a black comedy , and ends up a horror-action film . \nthe mix between these genres are perfect . \nno laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror , and vice versa . \none point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman . \nbut that hardly seems like a flaw when you have such a diverse cast all in top form . \nmichael j . fox delivers one of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow of his wife\'s death , and then is forced to confront this later on . \nalvarado , looking like andie macdowell , makes a great frightened , tough , and smart heroine . \nand jeffery combs , as a paranoid fbi agent , is brilliantly bizaare . \nthe frighteners never once feels like it is running long . \nthe first hour is as funny as any comedy this year , and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters . \nthis movie is probably what casper would\'ve looked like if david lynch directed it . \nit\'s easily the best film of the year , so far . \n',pos
'before you read my review , you gotta know that i love woody allen . \nthis is a very important note because allen\'s films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone . \ni know folks who believe him to be a complete genius , while others see him as a dirty ol\' schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again . \ni love most of his films , but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s . \nin fact , why he felt the need to make 10 movies in those 10 years is beyond me ! \nif you look at the quality of those films , you\'ll hear what i\'m saying . \nthe only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives . \nin fact , i secretly hoped that he would take some \" time off \" at the turn of the millennium , just to re-energize or something , but it doesn\'t appear as though he has any intention of doing that . \nso here i am again , reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old . \nplot : the year is 1940 and woody allen is a top-notch insurance investigator . \nhis methods are very old-fashioned and apparently out of date . \na new employee ( hunt ) has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency . \nthe two do not like each other . \none night , they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician , and unbeknownst to them , placed under his control . \nsoon thereafter , jewels are stolen , words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer . \ncritique : a wonderful recreation of the 1940s style movies , with the fast-talking witty banter between co-workers , a catchy jazz score moving things along , film noirish elements such as the veronica lake-type sexpot , one-liners galore and a fluffy , if inconsequential plotline . \non the downside , the film actually starts off pretty slowly , with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there , but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy . \nthe sets , on the other hand , were amazing , the production design and costumes were perfect , and the casting ideal , so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man . \nbut it wasn\'t not long before i was fully engaged by the characters , entertained by the many zingers delivered back-and-forth between allen and hunt , and actually interested in the resolution of the flick . \ni also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old , parody and actual reinvention ( note theron\'s entire female persona that is drenched in film noir- very cool ) . \nof course , films like this ( with little or no real tension in the plot ) need solid actors to keep you interested in the quick-fire dialogue , and once again , allen does a great job in playing his character , who for once , isn\'t his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude . \nhe actually plays a \" macho \" guy here and handles it pretty well , especially the scenes in which he\'s hypnotized . \nbut the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt , an actress who i was openly \" sick of seeing \" in movies late last year ( sorry babe , you were just in too many at the same time ! ) . \nanyway , she\'s really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men , and doesn\'t miss a beat of allen\'s fast-paced dialogue . \ni didn\'t care much for her running joke about him \" dying \" whenever he left a room , but overall she was really good and i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did . . . yum , \nyum ! \nharumph , but i digress . \nso let\'s recap . \na great looking picture with a nice jazzy score , some funny one-liners , especially in the second half , a decent plotline , although you shouldn\'t expect a real mystery or anything , and some solid acting all around . \ni can\'t say that this is even remotely close to any of allen\'s best work , but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction , especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through . \nit\'s probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else , but i would still recommend this film to anyone looking for a cute , \" old-school \" kind of vibe , with chemistry between the leads , zippy dialogue and a satisfying conclusion . \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : annie hall ( 10/10 ) - celebrity ( 5/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) - husbands and wives ( 9/10 ) - mighty aphrodite ( 5/10 ) - small time crooks ( 7/10 ) - when harry met sally ( 10/10 ) - you\'ve got mail ( 4/10 ) \n',pos
'susan granger\'s review of \" legally blonde \" ( m . g . m . ) \nit\'s a \" pretty in pink \" / \" clueless \" coming-of-age story for the new millennium as elle woods ( reese witherspoon ) , a perky southern california sorority queen , switches from fashion to law in order to win back her yuppy boyfriend ( matthew davis ) . \nthe girl-power story begins as this sweetheart of delta nu is unceremoniously dumped by a bonehead who says : \" if i\'m going to be a senator by the time i\'m 30 . . . i \nneed to marry a jackie , not a marilyn . \" \ndetermined to prove she\'s as smart a snobby brunette ( selma blair ) from country-club connecticut , elle not only applies to harvard law school but gets in , much to the amazement of family , friends and faculty . \nonce there , this flaxen-haired fish-out-of-water not only survives but tenaciously thrives , befriending a local manicurist ( jennifer coolidge ) , dazzling a professor ( victor garber ) and rescuing a defendant ( ali larter ) in a celebrated boston murder trial , plus finding a more worthy beau ( luke wilson ) . \nin the tradition of teen-comedy film-maker john hughes and his disciple amy heckerling , there\'s wit , cheerfulness , a fidelity of observation and a penchant for problem-solving . \nfirst-time feature director robert luketic is blessed with reese witherspoon who\'s joyously incandescent in this utterly formulaic light comedy written by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith , based on a soon-to-be-published novel by amanda brown . \nthe supporting cast is terrific , particularly raquel welch and holland taylor - and i particularly got a kick out of the gag of elle distributing scented resumes in pink , her signature color on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" legally blonde \" is a frivolous , funny , feel-good 8 . \nfilled with ditzy blonde ambition , it\'s a movie for high-school kids that their parents would be happy to have them see . \n',pos

'martin scorsese\'s triumphant adaptation of edith wharton\'s the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker , the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life . \nit seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900\'s , but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder , and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker . \nthis is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese\'s finest . \nnewland archer ( day-lewis ) is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland ( ryder ) , a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker , who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful . \nthe marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families , in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others . \non the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may , countess ellen olenska ( pfeiffer ) , cousin of may , walks into archer\'s life . \narcher is immediately captivated , and finds himself in love with ellen . \narcher is also bound by the limits of new york society , which is an intrusive as any other in the world . \narcher finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska , attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status . \nthe film\'s subject matter may seem alien to scorsese , but the theme is definitely not . \nit is a theme of forbidden romance , guilty pleasures , and the consequences causes because of those actions . \nthere is a painstakingly flawed hero , and his choice between the life he wants , and the life he is destined for . \nin truth , it is a film about a society the audience doesn\'t know about , but wants to find out more , much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun . \nthe performances are absolutely breathtaking . \nday-lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take . \npfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska , a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well . \nryder is probably the gem of the group , for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot , and slowly pushes day-lewis closer and closer to his eventual ending . \nthe supporting cast is also wonderful , with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one\'s memory . \nscorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking . \nhis lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight . \nhe literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery . \nhis script is also excellent , slow in buildup , with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed . \nit is difficult to make a period piece gripping : scorsese , however , does it beautifully . \nthe famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere . \nhe is patient , but he films everything and anything remotely important . \nthe cameras sweep , pan , track , and do more than they\'ve ever done , but they are so subtle , one doesn\'t realize he\'s watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing . \nthe central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot , but the viewer doesn\'t notice it , because we want to see more of this gorgeous world . \nthere are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding , and joanne woodward\' narration is exquisite . \nnot a fast film like goodfellas , this shares more in common with kundun than anything else . \nand like kundun , this is a slow-starting film that truly shines , when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end . \na beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year . \n',pos

'wyatt earp has a lot to tell and little to say . \nthis story of the legendary lawman runs three hours and nine minutes and that\'s too long for this epic-wannabe that plays more like a tv mini-series than a movie . \nthe story opens on the earp family farm , with young wyatt ready to run away from home . \nhe wants to fight in the civil war , but his dad ( hackman ) has different ideas and wants his son to study law . \ntime passes and wyatt heads west , returns home to marry , and , after a spell , begins his career in law enforcement . \nby the time he ( costner ) and his brothers ( madsen , david andrews , and linden ashby ) arrive in tombstone , wyatt has tried his hand at everything from hunting buffalo to dealing cards . \nwyatt earp is very appealing in places-- such as cast , costumes , and cinematography-- but an overstated story and overpowered score deaden most of the emotional impact . \nwho can be moved by scene after scene after scene of swelling strings and suffocating speeches ? \nsomber is fine-- just ask clint eastwood-- but this film that boasts not one , not two , but three , count \'em three , hammy death scenes ! \nstill , a little bit of earp goes a long way and the life and times of the legendary lawman are from uninteresting stuff . \nhis , uh , unusual relations with women , for example , are an intriguing contrast to his character\'s credo of \" nothing counts as much as blood . \" \nequally amusing is a buffalo-hunting ( and skinning ! ) \nsequence that is decidedly non-pc . \ndirector lawrence kasdan takes a refreshingly realistic approach to the gunplay . \nthe infamous gunfight at the ok corral is both brutal and brief , devoid of almost any theatrics . \ndon\'t look for much glorified violence here . \ndespite some large exclamation points in the story , the characters * do * come to life . \nthe diverse cast includes everyone from betty buckley ( ! ) to mackenzie astin ( ! ! ) . \nkevin costner is very good in the title role . \ndances with whitney nevers get as steely as the role requires , though , but his transformation from lighthearted law student to stoic sheriff is fun to watch . \nhe was tougher in a perfect world . \nhis foil is dennis quaid , who pulled a deniro by losing 40+ pounds to play the tubercular terror doc holliday . \ngaunt * and * gamely , he\'s a scene stealer who\'s seen too little . \nother familiar faces include tom sizemore ( looking like bruce mcgill ) , bill pullman ( looking like jeff daniels ) , and lea thompson ( looking like someone other than lea thompson ) . \nboth gene hackman and isabella rosselini appear and disappear like magic , while late entries catherine o\'hara and jobeth williams are surprisingly solid . \nthough the story and score should\'ve tried \" less is more , \" all other credits are technical tops . \nproduction designer ida random , art director gary wissner , and costume designer colleen atwood are some of the vips who helped spend what must\'ve been an enormous budget . \nclearly no expense was spared . \n',pos
'when i first heard that kevin costner was making a movie called \" the postman , \" i thought , \" an american version of \'il postino ? \' \nstarring costner ? \ngod help us ! \" \nwhen i found out that it was not a remake of \" postino \" but an postapocalyptic epic , i thought , \" \'landworld ? \' \nplease , god , make him stop ! \" \nas it turns out , \" the postman \" is a much better film than i had expected . \ndespite being set in 2013 , the movie is , at heart , a western : a band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers ; a wandering hero opposes the bandits and inspires others to fight back . \nthe setting , however , allows that familiar plot to take on greater significance : american society has collapsed due to plagues and wars , and survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages . \nthe struggle of a dead society to be reborn has a grand quality and deserves the epic scale costner grants it . \ncostner\'s nameless character , a wandering actor , rides in from the vast wasteland and is soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem ( will patton ) , a former copy-machine salesman turned bandit king . \nour hero escapes and discovers the body of a dead postman . \ntaking the uniform and bag of mail , he passes himself off as a representative of \" the restored united states . \" \nhe is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the people he meets . \none young disciple , ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , organizes a full-scale postal service . \nford spreads the postman\'s message of hope until bethlehem finds that the once-meek villagers are beginning to resist his rule . \nas war breaks out between bethlehem\'s army and the postal workers , costner\'s character steps into the legend he created and goes from self-centered loner to leader of the revolution . \nhis lie of the restored united states becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy . \n \" postman \" is an odd blend of a bleak setting and a message of wide-eyed optimism ( sort of \" sergio leone meets frank capra \" ) , but its treatment of hope and renewal is compelling . \nwhat could have been another knock-off of \" the road warrior \" ( like \" waterworld \" was ) surprises the viewer with a sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble . \ntate is the stand-out in the movie\'s large cast . \nford lincoln mercury ( self-named ) is the polar opposite of o-dog , tate\'s character in his debut film , \" menace ii society \" ( 1993 ) , and tate makes ford\'s innocent belief in hope as convincing as o-dog\'s cynicism and brutality . \nhis performance sells the movie . \ninterestingly , as tate moves from his usual street-smart roles to youthful optimism , the soft-eyed patton , who usually plays nice guys , proves a disarming villain . \nolivia williams makes her film debut as the postman\'s love interest , abby . \nwhen they first meet , abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile . \npredictably , the husband is soon eliminated by the bandits , and abby is thrown back into the company of the hero . \nhowever , their relationship develops slowly as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored ( she , torn by grief , guilt , and anger ; he , resisting his destiny ) . \n \" the postman \" is costner\'s best work thus far . \nperhaps that alone gives us hope for the future . \n . \n . \n',pos
'in zoolander , the world\'s most successful , influential and intellectually-challenged male model derek zoolander wonders , \" is there more to life than being really really really good looking ? \" \nobviously , the film\'s creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature-length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short-film subject : can there be more to this film than being really really really silly ? \nno , of course not , and it never aspires to be anything more . \nmuch like derek , zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie . \nit\'s not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy , and it never produces any gut-busting laughs ( except maybe a scene when derek\'s model roommates all die in a tragic \" gasoline fight \" accident -- a riotously funny take-off of tommy hilfiger ads ) . \nbut it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles , wild characters and performances , and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused . \nbetter yet , this exaggerated version of the original three-minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag . \nzoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs . \nfashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu ( will ferrell ) drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed . \nenter derek , whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel ( owen wilson ) takes the spotlight . \non the trail of mugatu\'s plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries ( stiller\'s real-life wife christine taylor ) , and she\'s hoping to use mugatu\'s pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme . \nmuch like the austin powers films , zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved , and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today . \nwilson is hysterical as the young , vain hansel . \nferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant , freakish mugatu in the same way dr . evil upstages everyone in austin powers . \njerry stiller -- ben\'s dad who\'s best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld -- makes a priceless turn as derek\'s slimy agent maury ballstein . \neven ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged , large-assed masseuse . \nas for ben stiller , it seems his derek has one gag : he\'s stupid , which plays out in some uproarious one-liners . \nunfortunately , taylor seems out of place and out of her league here . \nmaybe it\'s just because i can\'t stop seeing her as marcia brady ( who she played in both brady movies ) , making her unbelievable as a dowdy , brainy plain jane who hasn\'t had sex in two years . \nshe leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo , who would\'ve added real comic substance to the flimsy role . \nwhile zoolander is hardly highbrow , its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times , especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days . \nzoolander\'s no masterpiece , but a very worthy distraction . \n',pos
'originally titled \'don\'t lose your head\' , this parody of the scarlet pimpernel story was the first carry on to be produced by rank film productions . \ntwo english fops , the \'powdered , be-wigged , be-ribboned\' sir rodney ffing ( sidney james ) and his counterpart lord darcy pew ( jim dale ) decide to travel to revolutionary france in an attempt to rescue their fellow french royalists and aristocrats from losing their heads by the guillotine . \ndue to a series of machinations and disguises , they are largely successful . \nffing becomes known as \'the black fingernail\' because he leaves a calling card behind which shows two fingers sticking up , one with a black fingernail . \nafter the fingernail rescues a prominent royalist the duc de pommfrit ( charles hawtrey ) , citizen robespierre ( peter gilmore ) orders the head of the secret police citizen \'the big cheese\' camembert ( kenneth williams ) and citizen bidet ( peter butterworth ) to follow the fingernail to england and do away with him . \n ( in fact , darcy and ffing are their coachmen ! ) \nonce at calais , the fingernail meets jacqueline ( dany robin ) and they fall in love instantly . \nhe tells her his identity and gives her his locket . \nwhen camembert realises that the fingernail is nearby , he searches the inn at calais and captures jacqueline , thinking that she is wearing a diguise and is really the fingernail ! \njacqueline is imprisoned in the bastille and camembert , his love desiree dubarry ( joan sims ) , and bidet all travel to london in pursuit of the fingernail . \nthey pretend to be of noble stock , calling themselves the duc and duchesse de la plume de ma tante ( with bidet their assistant ) and are invited by darcy to a ball held by ffing . \ndesiree finds out that ffing is the fingernail by wearing the locket around her neck , but she ends up falling in love with him . \nffing attempts to stall camembert so that he can return to the bastille to rescue jacqueline , camembert has her moved to the \'chateau neuve\' , and a climactic sword-fight decides who will lose their heads at the end of the film ! \na more complex story than most carry ons , this film enjoys good production values ( sets , costumes ) and an on-form cast . \nsid james is excellent as the english fop and black fingernail , kenneth williams excels as the evil camembert , and peter butterworth expertly plays the substantial part of camembert\'s thick-witted crony . \nother acting honours go to joan sims who is perfect as desiree and charles hawtrey who is excellent as the french aristo pommfrit . \nalthough it suffers from a disasterously over-long sword fight at the end of the film , it is largely successful due to the performances of the main stars , its slick and professional production , and its better-than-usual script . \ndefinitely one of the best of the series and a joy to watch . \n',pos
'if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it\'s their predictable endings . \nthe devil\'s advocate has the atypical hollywood ending , when everything that should happen does . \nunfortunately for the devil\'s advocate , this ending nearly collapses in on itself , and ruins the entire film . \nnevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film ) . \ni don\'t think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan . \nwell , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that ) . \nthe devil\'s advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session . \nkevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl . \nhe ends up with a not-guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo ) . \nhe leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury . \nhe accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife . \nafter proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer . \nhe graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god . \nhe is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck . \nhis life seems to be on the rise . \nand of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline . \nhe is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment . \nmary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted . \nmeanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t . nelson ) who apparently murdered three people . \nhe spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane . \nall of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself . \nafter a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin\'s wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends . \na fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin\'s real father . \nis it all just a big nightmare ? \nor is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin\'s life ? \nthe devil\'s advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don\'t expect . \nis this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ? \nif so , the devil\'s advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early . \ni went into the devil\'s advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got . \ni was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got . \nbut what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn\'t like the ending ? ) . \nthe producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you . \nfilms like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less . \nwe know it is going to end in an unpredictable way . \nthe devil\'s advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all . \nif that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again . \nas for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study . \nthe film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) . \nand then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur . \nit was at this point that i felt cheated . \ntaking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film . \neverything occurs from his perspective . \nhe is our representation on screen ( sort of ) . \nbut we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game . \ni don\'t want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself . \nperhaps the most shocking thing about the devil\'s advocate is the extreme amount of everything . \nit earned its r rating for a reason . \nthere is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity . \nthis film really isn\'t subtle about anything , showing us everything . \nit actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh . \nhowever , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those . \ni don\'t condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it . \nthe biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch . \nthe confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann . \nportrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann\'s problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline . \nthis may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her . \nshe is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted . \nsomething the devil\'s advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature . \nthe story actually has something to say about humanity . \nin one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) . \nhe comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity . \nthen , god sets up rules which contradict human nature . \nthis semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening . \nwhat milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true . \nthese moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil\'s advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i\'m sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) . \nwhen a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched . \nthe cast of the devil\'s advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don\'t expect . \nheather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job . \nprobably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves . \nhe has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance . \ni have never seen him more believable to date . \nal pacino is of course the scene stealer . \nhis devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) . \nhe could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) . \njeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller\'s day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon . \njudith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin\'s past . \nconnie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times . \none familiar face with a twist was \" coach \" star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance . \nthe devil\'s advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore . \nat 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly . \nfor the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters . \nthe technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score . \ndirector taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes . \ni guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time . \nbut just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream . \npersonally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early . \n',pos
'ingredients : down-on-his-luck evangelist , church \nsynopsis : sonny dewey ( robert duvall ) is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife ( farrah fawcett ) in bed with another guy . \nin a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy\'s head , and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder , and estranged from his wife and two kids . \nto atone for his sins , sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature - - the apostle e . f . as the apostle e . f . sonny\'s main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station . \nsoon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple . \nbut sonny knows his time is short ; one day the police will find him . \nopinion : this movie is a thought-provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms . \ni believe that robert duvall ( who is the producer , director , writer , and main star of the apostle ) deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader - - a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film . \nduvall\'s portrayal of a true believer is authentic , superb , and inspired ; it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion , as well as a portrait of a fallible , complicated man driven by his beliefs . \nincidentally , in real life duvall was just as \'driven\' in getting the project underway . \nsince no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist , the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done , paying for its production with his own money ( about five million dollars ) . \nin terms of hard-hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade , and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film . \nsimilarly , those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thought-provoking experience . \non the other hand , the apostle\'s main strength - - duvall\'s preaching - - is also what limits the apostle\'s target audience . \nin terms of plot and pure entertainment value , the apostle is definitely not for everyone . \nteenagers , action fans , comedy fans , and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie , since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church . \nin other words , the apostle is a four star performance , but with a very limited audience . \n',pos
'the most amazing thing about paul cox\'s innocence is how unlike a movie it is . \ni mean that as the highest compliment . \nif most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40-year-old romance , i\'d want to run and hide . \nthe sex scenes would be handled as a farce , producers would shed 20 years off the characters\' ages ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence . \nalong with a charming romantic story , the australian/belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable . \nthe romance gets started when former musician andreas ( charles \" bud \" tingwell ) , learns that his true love , claire ( julia blake ) , lives nearby . \nthey decide to catch up on old times , but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair . \ncomplicating matters is andreas\' frail health , and claire\'s longtime husband ( terry norris ) , who can\'t understand why he\'s suddenly become obsolete . \nin my mind , the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire , than the feelings of everyone involved . \njohn , claire\'s husband , endlessly questions what he did wrong . \nclaire initially insists she\'s a grown-up , but admittedly behaves like a child , a prospect that thrills and disappoints her . \nandreas , an agnostic , begins to question his fate , a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence . \ncox litters the movie with flashbacks , including the repeated vision of a roaring train . \nit\'s a reminder of andreas and claire\'s past love ( as young lovers , they met by train ) , but as it recurs , we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed . \na pall is cast on the whole affair . \na master of the understated , cox strings together a series of memorable moments . \nin andreas\' dream sequence , amidst the roar of the train and conversations , we get the whole picture of andreas and claire\'s love . \nwe also get glimpses into john and claire\'s relationship . \nduring a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward , claire admits to john about her indiscretion , telling more than any monologue could . \nall that\'s heard is the scraping of forks against plates . \nthe characters are unlike anything i\'ve seen -- they\'re people . \nso many times , movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky . \nor they\'re reduced to comedic buffoons . \nordinary people with a pile of emotions , claire and andreas aren\'t sure what the next step is . \nthey do want to be happy , which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they\'ve known throughout their adult lives . \nbravo to cox , who wrote the script , for not making john a monster , so that claire\'s affair is automatically justified . \nnorris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claire\'s love difficult to accept . \nwe feel for him . \nhe\'s a decent man . \nsure , he may have become complacent , but he never expected this , especially now . \nwith so much presented to the audience , it\'s only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive , which it does . \nhowever , in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers , cox displays a skill and ? lan isn\'t likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon . \n',pos
'contact is a film that tries to do several different things . \nit is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) . \nthe film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals . \nthe portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv\'s the x-files . \nthe aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else . \nthey know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person . \nthe film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters\' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick\'s 2001 : a space odyssey . \nmost of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens . \nscientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between . \nthe debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway\'s atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind\'s representative to another species . \nthe film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed . \nstill , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society . \nthe two \" sides \" are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80\% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists . \npalmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology . \nthen again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions . \ncontact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself . \nthe film\'s one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss . \nfor one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction . \nthe romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss\'s explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( \" i guess you could say i\'m a man of the cloth , but without the cloth \" ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development . \ninstead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments . \ngranted , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers\' part more than anything else . \nthe successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures . \neven if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn\'t ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film . \ncontact doesn\'t quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and its rejection of big-budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable . \nand i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction . \n',pos
'billy bob thornton , who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996\'s sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer , is becoming one of the most versatile - and most accomplished - american actors around at the moment . \nas jacob , the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton\'s hank , thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers . \nthree men , hank ( paxton ) , jacob ( thornton ) and their friend lou ( brent briscoe ) stumble upon a plane wreck which , upon closer inspection , yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money . \njacob and lou want to pocket the cash . \nhank , the smarter - and perhaps more naive - of the three , insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find . \neventually , they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found , and then split the money three ways . \nthings start going wrong , though , with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan . \ndisaster is sure to strike . \ndirector sam raimi , of the evil dead and darkman fame , has made an excellent and thought-provoking film , worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name . \nwhile there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work , raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come . \nscott b . smith\'s screenplay , based on his novel ( which i haven\'t read ) is a fine example of escalating tension . \nwhile it does remind one of danny boyle\'s shallow grave without the abundance of black humour , it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality , or the lack thereof , found in a film with this subject matter . \nalar kivilo\'s cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coen\'s fargo , with the bleak , snowy landscape almost becoming another character . \ndanny elfman also does well with his moody , finely-written score . \nif there\'s a flaw in the film , it\'s that it goes on for just a little too long . \njust when we think that they are about to wrap things up , raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further . \nwhile this isn\'t really a bad thing , it did become a little frustrating at times ( this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand ) . \nthe performances are excellent , with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scene-stealing turn as hank\'s scheming wife . \nthis is an excellent showcase for thornton\'s fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi , who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films . \nfingers crossed , though , that this doesn\'t stop him from making another evil dead sequel . \n',pos
'tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently . \nthe dalai lama has made speaking tours , tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops , the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months . \n \" kundun \" ( \" presence \" , a name the monks call the young dalai lama ) opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader . \na group of monks enters a village and a two-year-old child catches their attention . \nthe young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as \" mine \" . \nhe and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country . \nhe is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in 1950 . \nthe peaceful and isolated country is ill-equipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results . \neventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india . \ncomparisons to \" seven years in tibet \" are inevitable . \nboth films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerner\'s point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt . \n \" kundun \" features only native actors and is more of an insider\'s story . \nin some ways , this makes this film a superior concept , but it lacks the movement and spark that made \" seven years \" such an audience-pleaser . \nthe actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie ( filmed in morocco for obvious reasons ) . \nthe only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computer-generated character . \non an intellectual level , it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts . \nsome events are depicted differently and pitt\'s austrian mountain-climber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lama\'s life isn\'t even mentioned here . \nglossed over in \" seven years \" , the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses \" we were just about to change things \" after the chinese attack . \nthe film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins . \nhis lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail . \nespecially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain . \nthe visual treats more than make up for the movie\'s faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience . \nwalking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience . \nmartin scorsese , known for his dark tales of the underworld ( \" goodfellas \" , \" taxi driver \" , \" casino \" ) has shifted gears . \nsomething of a thematic follow-up to his \" the last temptation of christ \" , this is his slowest film yet . \noddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese , most of these events take place off-screen . \nhis decision to not over-explain rituals is commendable . \nthe stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoon-fed interpretations . \nphilip glass\'s score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting . \ni talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again . \nhearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india , i was struck by what was missing in the movie . \nas grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is , there is a distance between the audience and the movie . \nthe film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings . \nwith the exception of a few scenes , involvement with the characters is slight . \none of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama , shown as a mischievous boy who can\'t resist being a kid sometimes . \nan encounter with his older brother thubten j . norbu ( a retired indiana university professor ) who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment , but there aren\'t many of these . \neven with its problems , the \" kundun \" experience is phenomenal , but one that i fear most will miss . \nmany people who saw \" seven years in tibet \" will have a \" been there , done that \" attitude . \nit\'s likely that the film will miss a wide-spread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping . \n',pos
'i swear i have seen the edge before . \nin fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film . \nhowever , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot . \nin doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker . \nunfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film . \nbut leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head . \none surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script . \naction films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence . \neven horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all . \nthe river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s . \nthe intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day . \nthe edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall . \ni must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes . \nthis is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world ) . \nif only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes\' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) . \nthe edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film . \nbut taking scream\'s lead , the edge makes fun of the genre\'s cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively ) . \ncharles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him . \nfor once , we don\'t immediately care for the main character . \ninstead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles\' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness . \nthey board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic . \ncharles\' birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob . \nas action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect . \nsoon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his \" personality . \" \ncharles , bob , bob\'s assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter . \ndown the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness . \ndirector lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations . \nhe succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film . \ntake , for instance , the entire man-hunting bear plot . \nthis has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears . \nbut given the charles\' intelligence , and bob\'s uncertainty , many of the cliches are given fresh twists . \neven charles himself seems to have seen these action films before . \nmy favorite line of the film comes from charles : \" most people die in the wilderness because they didn\'t do the one thing that could save their life . . . \nthinking . \" \ndespite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn\'t as it seems anymore . \ni have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely . \nthe first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles\' survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice . \ntamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear , but whenever the bear is present , the characters lose all sensibility . \ni have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water . \nwhy not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ? \ni guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while . \nthankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide . \nbut some of the technical details are awkward , such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make ( where did they get thread and needles ? ) . \nthe acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature , and borders on phenomenal . \nanthony hopkins gives a terrific performance , creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day . \nhopkins usually brings greatness to his roles , but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences\' sympathy , something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs . \nalec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) . \nbaldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way . \nyou can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double-natured photographer . \nelle macpherson gives a good performance , albeit slight . \nshe isn\'t in the film all that much , but for the scenes she does have , she handles as an actress , not as a model . \nharold perrineau is a good actor , and his scenes are nice and underplayed . \nhe is eliminated early , and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable . \nthe edge is rated r for graphic violence , some gore , and language . \nsome of the violence is a little too disturbing , even for me . \nthis film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to , but too many cliches bog it down . \ndirector tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts . \ndavid mamet\'s script , though , has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat , and the acting is solid . \nthe best thing about the script is the ending which doesn\'t end with the normal high-strung action sequence , but with a small detail involving a certain gift . \nit\'s a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear . \nand by the way , most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear . \nway to go , bart . \n',pos
'one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made , \" se7en \" is just a few steps away from brilliance . \nhowever , those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss . \nthe film received mixed reviews upon release , but there\'s an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice . \nat times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing , but the script and the ultimate pay-off are excellent . \nthe shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable . \nthis piece of work is 100\% intensity . \nit\'s uncomfortable to watch , yet compelling . \n \" i want not to look , yet i cannot turn away . \" \nthe story creeps along slowly and deliberately , crafted by visionary director david fincher . \nhe has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions , but not giving away too much too soon . \nthis is the guy who directed the ominous \" alien 3 \" . \n \" se7en \" is even more ominous because the threat is real . \nit\'s human and , while the script takes some artistic licence , the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic . \nthat is , if a human being could be so intelligent , patient , wealthy , and disillusioned . \nafter the most bizarre opening credits i\'ve ever seen ( refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment ) , the initial character development takes place . \nmorgan freeman stars as detective william somerset , a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society . \nbrad pitt co-stars as detective david mills , the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys . \nthese two fine actors give the film its human qualities ( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow , who plays tracy , mills\' wife ) . \nhowever , none of them stands out above the material . \nno disrespect intended , but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same . \nan ironic note is that somerset has only a week ( or 7 , that\'s seven , days ) left on the force to train his young protege . \nthe title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins , as chronicled by john milton in \" paradise lost \" --gluttony , greed , sloth , lust , pride , envy , & wrath . \nincidentally , i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found . \nit\'s the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking , but i won\'t give that away . \nas i said , this has a great ending and no one should spoil it . \nanyway , the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the \" sinners \" suffer for it . \nthe two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man . \nthey learn that he was murdered--forced to eat himself to death . \nthe killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and , of course , somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way . \nif they didn\'t , it would be one short movie ! \nthe deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story . \nwe see a lot of blood , but it\'s not especially violent . \nthe suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown--like most of the violence in \" pulp fiction \" . \n \" se7en \" is gory , graphic , and disturbing , but all the gore is post-death . \nstill , if you tend to get queasy , don\'t eat food during this film . \nkevin spacey plays john doe , the avenging angel who claims that he\'s the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings . \nlike many crazy men , he has some fine ideas , but some sick ways of expressing himself . \nspacey doesn\'t appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesn\'t receive billing in the opening credits . \nhowever , it\'s his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination . \na great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not . \nthis character is so well written that it\'s hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone . \nno serial killer has ever been so creative . \n \" se7en \" is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and it\'s often a little too depressing . \nwhat it lacks in those areas , it makes up for with believable dialogue , top-notch screenwriting , unexpected twists , and realistic characters . \nthe technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive . \nfincher uses lighting , music , and editing quite well , but his story is always the thrust of the film . \nfortunately , we don\'t find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits ( which are run backwards up the screen ! ) . \nit\'s better to imagine what paths they will follow . \nthis is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget . \nit\'s got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thing--the evils of the world aren\'t going to cure themselves . \n \" se7en \" raises some tough questions and it\'s intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves . \nuseless trivia--co-stars in 1995\'s \" se7en \" , brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the 1995 best supporting actor oscar--pitt in \" 12 monkeys \" , spacey in \" the usual suspects \" ( for which he won ) . \n',pos
'there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review , not because of their own complexity , but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original . \none of such masterpieces is casablanca , probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art , but definitely the most popular one . \nits popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere , but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day . \ncasablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience . \none of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail , at least judging by conventional movie-making wisdom of its time . \nit was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn\'t been produced on stage ; screenplay by three writers - julius g . epstein , philip j . epstein and howard koch - was beeing written as shooting went along ; the main actors were producers\' second choice , and , finally , man behind camera , michael curtiz was considered to be capable , but not great director . \nhowever , the movie was commercially successful and earned three \" oscars \" , including the one for the best film . \nuntil this very day , it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film- making in its own golden age . \nthe plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda , yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story . \nin december 1941 , casablanca , exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral , yet nazi-collaborating french vichy government . \nthousands of refugees from war-torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america , and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas . \nmany shady characters thrive on their misery , including the corrupt police chief , captain renault ( rains ) . \nhis best friend is rick blaine ( bogart ) , who used to be idealistic anti-fascist , and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of \" sticking his neck for nobody \" . \nhowever , everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas . \nthis event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca . \none of them is victor laszlo ( henreid ) , czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe . \nhe is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund ( bergman ) , with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris . \nthe couple needs visas , especially because of the gestapo major strasser ( veidt ) being on their trail . \nrick is now forced to choose between love , wounded pride , self-preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism . \nthe casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration - humphrey bogart , most legendary actor in the history of cinema , is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status . \nbogart\'s portrayal of rick as complicated man , torn between idealistic past and bitter present , was so perfect , that his icon would forever be connected with that character . \nanother icon in his company is ingrid bergman , great actress of old hollywood , here in her artistic and visual prime . \nthe cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking - some happier times when the romance on the screen didn\'t look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works . \nfor many people , casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made . \nbut the reason for that isn\'t the romance itself - it\'s the realistic story of people forced to make tough , and often wrong choices in their life . \nthe casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads . \nthe supporting actors also did a marvellous job . \nsidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic - john huston\'s maltese falcon ; yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters . \nanother shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle ; character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny . \nunfortunately , the charisma that burdened laszlo , leaves little place for difficult choice , making his character forever overshadowed by rick/ilsa coupling . \nhowever , rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca . \ncaptain renault , brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime , was embodiment of perfect , almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm . \ndespite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie , rains managed to make renault sympathetic character , and his final conversion to the side of good , symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary . \nrains also gave another dimension to the movie , making it even more ambiguous ; people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renault\'s relationship towards rick , and rick\'s final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations . \ntogether with well-drawn characters and exciting story , the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere . \nprofessional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies , but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable , if not realistic . \nany way , even if we don\'t see it as a historical document , casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration . \n',pos
'like the great musical pieces of mozart himself , amadeus is a true work of art . \nit is one of those few movies of the 80\'s that will be known for its class , its style , and its intelligence . \nwhy is this such a good film ? \nthere are almost too many reasons to explain . \nthe story : court composer salieri ( f . \nmurray abraham ) feels waves of different emotions going through his head as wolfgang amadeus mozart ( tom hulce ) comes into his life as the young genius composer . \nsalieri feels envy , and jealousy , but at the same time is fascinated with mozart\'s brilliance and ingenious . \nwe travel through mozart\'s life as a composer , through his struggles , his triumphs , and ultimately , his demise . \nthe acting : abraham is magnificient as salieri ; his acting range enables him to focus on each individual emotion and express it through his speech and body language . \nthis performance earned him a well deserved oscar . \ntom hulce is interesting as well as mozart , a quirky , annoying bratty kid with an annoying laugh . \nhe\'s strong , but weak at the same time , and must be aided by his wife ( elizabeth berridge ) , who is good in her role , but lacks dramatic depth . \njeffrey jones , in a smaller , more dignified role than such roles in stay tuned and mom and dad save the world , is cast perfectly because of his noble charm . \nthe movie : every element of this movie works . \nthe costumes and makeup are very memorable , as well as its stunning art direction , and unforgettable scores ( adapted from mozart\'s original music ) . \nwhile wolfgang amadeus mozart was a genius at music , milos forman proves with his film that he is a genius of filmmaking . \nthis movie is a classic that will be remembered for years to come . \nad2am \" i almost lost my nose . . . and \ni like it . \ni like breathing through it . \" \n-jack nicholson , chinatown \n',pos
'armageddon , in itself , symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking . \nstories have been replaced with special effects ; character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue ; plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up . \narmageddon is as stupid , as loud and as shallow as any movie you\'ll see come out this summer , or maybe even any other summer . \nbut i loved every freaking minute of it . \nbelieve me , i\'m just as shocked as you are . \nhell , i don\'t even know why i went to see it in the first place . \nthe previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year , or at least in the running . \ni\'m sorry , but \" somebody dial 911 ! ! ! \" \nisn\'t quite the tagging that\'s going to sell a movie . \nit isn\'t too wise either to market the film using the movie\'s stupidest lines ( \" beam me up scotty \" - yeah , that sure is great writing . . . ) . \ni mean , let\'s face it ; armageddon\'s previews rival the truman show\'s as being some of the worst of the year . \nneither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice . \nof course , you all know the story . \nwhen the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas , nasa calls in the us\'s top oil drillers ( ! ) to go into space ( ! ) and implant a nuclear device eight-hundred and someodd feet into the asteroid ( ! ) . \nin the coarse of all this mayhem , we are introduced to some interesting - and not so interesting - characters . \nbelonging to the former group is rockhound ( steve buscemi ) , a horny little womanizing genius who\'s always full of wisecracks , even when flying into space at a huge amount of g\'s . \nalso , there\'s the always cool-as-hell billy bob thornton as dan truman , the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers . \nhe kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13 , only without the intensity and great lines to deliver . \nthen on the flip side of the coin is the tired , contrived character of harry stamper ( bruce willis , who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i can\'t quite place ) , the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie . \nbasically , that\'s about it . \nas i said , this is hardly a film about plot . \nit\'s another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden . \ncase in point : nasa doesn\'t know that there is even an asteroid on it\'s way until eighteen days before impact - huh ? \nanother example : at one point in the movie , two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy . \nhow pretentious is that ? ? ? ! ! ! \nwant another one ? \nokay ; before the oil drillers blast off into space , one of them starts singing \" leaving on a jet plane \" , and soon , all the rest join in . \ndid michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture ? \nbut naturally , all this sappiness , melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin\' time at the movies . \nand don\'t get me wrong - despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon , i still very much enjoyed it . \nso even if you don\'t win one of mcdonald\'s free tickets , it\'s still definitely worth checking out . \n',pos
'this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated . \nthere are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood\'s most famous celebrities , some fabulous animation and a compelling story . \nthis is the best we\'ve seen from disney since \" beauty and the beast \" ( 1996 ) . \nthis film begins an unspecified time following the happily-ever-after conclusion to toy story . \nin the aftermath of their earlier adventures , buzz ( voice of tim allen ) and woody ( voice of tom hanks ) are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony , content with their \" lives \" . \none day , andy broke woody\'s arm off , while playing with him . \nwoody is now officially discarged and worthless , left with his nightmares , where he lies in a trash can with the other discards . \nlater andy\'s mother decides to have a yard sale , and she collects a few old toys from her son\'s room . \nsince one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang , woody goes to the rescue , leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back . \nalthough his mission is successful , he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al ( voice of wayne knight ) spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale . \nthe cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series , \" woody\'s roundup . \" \nif he can acquire woody , al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit . \nso , after andy\'s mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy , al steals him , and it\'s up to the other toys , led by buzz , to go into the city to save their friend . \nand so , buzz , rex ( voice of wallace shawn ) , hamm ( voice of john ratzenberger ) , mr . potatohead ( voice of don rickles ) , and slinky ( voice of jim varney ) , go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend , they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys . \nthere are car chases , gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis ( who , by the way , resembles darth vader ) . \nmeanwhile , woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family - a cowgirl named jessie ( voice of joan cusack ) , a horse named bullseye , and a father figure called the prospector ( voice of kelsey grammar ) . \nthey offer him another life , as a celebrity -- a toy in a museum in japan . \nhe is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while ( before he grows up ) and be forgotten , or be admired by children for generations . \nthe problem is , if woody escapes from al\'s clutches and returns home , they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage . \na real effort is made in the technical department . \nthe animation is rich and colorful , with lots of wonderful details . the \" cinematography \" is also extremely improved since toy story ; there are a lot of complicated swings , turns and close-ups that really make an impression . \nlighting and filters are used to create a mood ( as in a surprisingly emotional moment - jessie\'s remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy ) the film contains a lot of in-side jokes ( such as the one about videogames ) , and entertaining parodies on \" jurassic park \" and \" star wars \" . \nthe film ends with the \" failed takes \" , the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv . \nthese outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film . \nbut what in the end makes \" toy story 2 \" a memorable experience is not the jokes , its multiple parodies or marvelous animation . \nit is its heart and emotions -- the story about the meaning of friendship , love and even life itself . \nit is not difficult to predict that \" toy story 2 \" would be a huge economical success , but its artistic achievement was unexpected . \nunexpected because the first film wasn\'t much more than a demonstration of special effects . \nbut mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn\'t produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs . \nbut here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film , making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years . \nthis is a big step-away from the ancient laws of disney-animation . \noff course , this is not \" antz \" , it is not as intelligent ; this is not a landmark and no masterpiece , but i promise that you\'ll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have . \nwhether this is the best animated film of the year , i dare not say . \nmy choice would probably be \" the iron giant \" , but ( along side with \" american pie \" ) this is the comedy of the year . \ni almost lost my hopes for disney , but \" toy story 2 \" proves that disney hasn\'t lost their ability to entertain . \n',pos
'not too many people know who james whale is , but it\'s a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies . \nif we are to believe the semi- biographical gods and monsters , whale would have wanted it to be that way . \nthis is an insightful , haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director , and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie . \ngods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale\'s life because it tracks only the final few days of his life , and it\'s probably a better movie for it . \nit\'s focus is on whale\'s ( ian mckellen ) untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) . \nit begins with whale ( a fairly talented artist , aside from being a director ) asking boone to \" sit for him , \" ( pose for a portrait ) . \nat first , boone doesn\'t realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man . \nwhen he does discover whale\'s sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid ( lynn redgrave ) , he is frightened , refusing to sit for the guy . \nbut he comes back , only to storm out again , disgusted with whale\'s \" locker room talk . \" \nboone returns yet another time , after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned \" locker room talk , \" and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening . \nmeanwhile , jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago . \nhis ailment leads to desperation and depression , which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor . \nwhat is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan fraser\'s bravura performance ; up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in ( blast from the past , for example ) . \ni was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here . \nthis is impressive because his character\'s dialogue is minimal , with mckellan doing most of the talking . \nthat requires fraser to act through body language ; a difficult skill to master , but something he proves capable of doing well . \nthis is not to ignore mckellan\'s oscar nominated turn . \nhe earned that nomination with his touching performance here ( although , at the risk of sounding like a philistine , i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination ) ; an understated , compelling gem . \nwhale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre , and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield . \nhe rejoiced in being free from it , only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people . \nin the end , perhaps , it is what killed him : the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \n',pos
'when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be \" you too can believe whales can fly \" . \nthen it was going to be \" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly \" . \nthen , it was going to be \" you too can believe wood sprites can fly \" . \nfinally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . . . \nthere\'s a lot of flying going on in this film ! \nas our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in . \nwell apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released . \npart of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release ) . \nsubsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) . \nto celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high . \nin an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us . \nafter the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters . \nis the format effective for the film ? \nwith a few exceptions , yes . \nthe first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven\'s fifth symphony . \nit\'s hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily . \neverything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts . \neventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things . \nthough this segment isn\'t very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies . \nthe next segment is set to ottorino respighi\'s \" the pines of rome \" . \nin this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape . \na whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack . \nhe is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the \" oceans \" of clouds . \nagain , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved . \nreportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size . \nthe cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images . \none especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent . \nabsolutely beautiful stuff . \nthe third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin\'s \" rhapsody in blue \" . \nthis segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york . \nthere\'s a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife . \ni won\'t go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending . \nunfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments . \nsegment four is set to dmitri shostakovich\'s \" piano concerto no . 2 \" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen\'s \" the steadfast tin soldier \" . \na one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can\'t see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester . \nthe jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina . \nlittle does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from . \nthe soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl . \nalthough the ending has been altered from the andersen story , \" the steadfast tin soldier \" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short . \nsome children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made . \nsegment five is the funniest of the bunch . \nset to camille saint-saens \" the carnival of the animals \" , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number . \nwhile it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy . \nsegment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it\'s the one that people remember most , \" the sorcerer\'s apprentice \" . \nthe story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo . \nunfortunately , the segment wasn\'t made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain . \nthere were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain . \nsimilar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18-plus screen theaters . \nsegment seven is set to sir edward elgar\'s \" pomp and circumstance march no . 1 \" and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character . \ndonald duck \" stars \" as an assistant to noah , whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark . \nduring the loading , donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn\'t make it on the boat . \nthey are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners . \ndespite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece , it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear-jerkers foisted on audiences these days . \npowerful stuff . \nsegment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich ? \" saving the best for last \" . \nset to igor stravinsky\'s \" the firebird \" , an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape . \ntrees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation . \nwhen the sprite examines the formation , it awakens and becomes the titular firebird . \nin a stunning spectacle , the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path , including everything that the sprite has worked to create . \nsome amazing animation is present here , and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone ( although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film ) . \nthe host segments are largely ( no pun intended ) throwaways , although steve martin\'s clip is pretty funny . \nbe sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin . \npenn and teller are usually funny , but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting . \nthe best segment comes from , of all people , bette midler , who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board . \npieces like flight of the bumblebee , a take on the four horsemen set to wagner\'s \" ride of the valkyries \" , and a strange segment prepared in the \'40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments . \nfor fans of visual stimulation or classical music , fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon . \nthe film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material . \nas i mentioned earlier in the review , if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film , fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters . \ni must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though . \nthen you too can believe that whales/triangle things/sprites can fly . \n[g] \n',pos
'it\'s tough to really say something nice about a type of person who\'s so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone , but by god , \" american history x \" does it , and for that , i commend it . \nit not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who\'s not what they are , and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off . \nthe subject of this film is one of them , but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack . \nhe\'s the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks . \nhe\'s so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process . \nhis name is derek vinyard , and he\'s played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he\'s almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x . when we first see him , he\'s clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he\'s attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn\'t need them . \nhe so believes in his convictions that he\'s willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years . \n \" american history x \" is about derek , how he became a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake . \nwe see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he\'s done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides . \nor at least , that\'s the intention . \nthe film\'s framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek\'s deep space 9 ) , is trying to \" correct \" him . \nwhen the film opens , danny has just written a book report on \" mein kampf , \" landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek\'s life and how it has gotten him nowhere . \ncoincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he\'s cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair . \nhe\'s just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he\'s wisened up . \nhe\'s no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who\'s becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle . \nbut danny won\'t . \nhe goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a couple of years ago . \nthe film circles around this , then spins off into non-linear flashbacks , all done in black and white . \nwe mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on . \nto them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them . \nand frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true . \n \" american history x \" is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next . \nin it , there are some of the best scenes i\'ve seen all year . \none scene features a dinner between derek\'s family , and his mother\'s newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek\'s rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould\'s reaction to derek\'s final summation is unnerrving ) . \nanother scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co-worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison . \nand another soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year . \nthere\'s much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand-outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d\'angelo ( as the long-suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he\'s given in what seems like a really long time ) . \nnorton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble . \nin only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best . \nthere\'s nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie , spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience , coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando . \nthat he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing . \nsadly enough , this isn\'t going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be . \nit\'s too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece . \nthe ending , especially , is pencilled in from other movies , tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon . \nsome of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches ( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the \" fat skinhead , \" whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more ) , and even the dramatic arc isn\'t as well travelled . \nfurlong\'s danny never seems to really be learning a lesson , since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view , and when he decides to make a change by the end ( which was inevitable ) , it doesn\'t seem like it has actually arrived there . \neven derek\'s descent into skinhead-dom doesn\'t seem justified . \nthough his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from \" boy meets world , \" and don\'t ask me how i know that ) is killed by a black junkie , and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently , there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs . \nas such , one can see why the director , tony kaye , wanted to have his name removed . \nsorta . \n \" american history x \" is a very good movie , and i was very moved by it , but it could be a lot better , and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential . \nsomewhere , he claims , there lies a tony kaye cut , and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton , who then ordered another cut , and that is thus . \nalthough he aimed for the directing credit to go to \" alan smithee , \" the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director , it wasn\'t allowed to him , under the grounds that once you disown a film , you can not badmouth it ( but really , that\'s the macguffin - no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval ) . \nkaye\'s right in that it\'s not up to par , even if he\'s not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par . \nthis will not be a \" do the right thing \" for the late 90s . \nyet it still gets its point across intelligently , and backs it up with its story ( its message , that one cannot be so enwrapped in one\'s own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur , is literally said over the narration , unfortunately ) . \nand even

'synopsis : as a response to accusations of sexual prejudice in the armed forces , a female naval intelligence officer is chosen to be a test case . \nif she can survive the demanding s . e . a . l . \ntraining , she will open the way for other women to be permitted to follow in her footsteps . \nthrow in a lot of political machinations , sabotage , brutality , water and sand and you have an entertaining movie . \nreview : the title of this movie turned me off at first . \ni mean \'gi jane ? \' ? ? ? ? ? \nthe other titles which were considered were more promising - in pursuit of honor or a matter of honor would have been acceptable although navy cross or undisclosed are a little meaningless as far as i\'m concerned . \ni went into this movie not liking the title and being one of those people who thinks that demi moore is absolutely ghastly as an actor . \nto my surprise i really enjoyed the movie . \nmoore as lieutenant jordan o\'neil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse for a gusty woman in a few good men . \nthe storyline is simple . \nanne bancroft playing senator lillian dehaven is a ruthless , machiavellian politician with an agenda to push . \nusing feminism to achieve political mileage , she forces the military powers that be to backdown and permit a test case to enter the highly intensive navy s . e . a . l . \ntraining . \njordan is selected due to the fact that she has it all - looks , brains and strength . \nthe training is gruelling and the indignity almost painful to watch . \nnonetheless , it\'s one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out and encourage the hapless hero/heroine along in his/her endeavours . \nsure , there are the stereotypical elements - inhuman treatment , sexual innuendo , resentful peers , pained boyfriend and sexist commanding officer . \nstepping away from the stereotypes though , viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from being nothing more than a brutal screamer . \nhis character exercises a little more intellectual rigour than you would normally expect from such a character . \njordan\'s boyfriend royce is also in the military . \nalthough they both started at the same time , due to the fact that he has seen active service , he has advanced through the ranks much more quickly than she has . \nroyce ( what is his surname ? \ndo we care ? ) \nalmost resents jordan\'s attempts to advance herself , although he quickly settles down to being doe-eyed and supportive . \nhis character seems to have been thrown in so that we know that you don\'t have to be a lesbian to want to be in the military . \nin parts , this is a very silly movie , with gratuitous lines and scenes thrown in for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived that it\'s hard not to cringe . \ni still liked it though . \nweaknesses in the script aside , this is a film which captures a heroic and reckless mood . \nas we watch jordan\'s battle , it\'s increasingly clear that it is a personal battle . \nthis is an individual\'s fight for self-advancement . \nwe don\'t have to have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings , we don\'t have to feel uncomfortable because we\'re having ideology thrust down our throats . \nit\'s enough that we can sit back and hope that this one person gets what she wants and we can admire her tenacity and determination without coming out and saying whether we believe women should go into combat or not . \n',pos
'the idea at the center of the devil\'s advocate , which is , thus far , one of the three or four best films of 1997 , is that no matter what decision is made , evil will triumph -- god is a trickster , satan is a humanist -- \" the last humanist \" . \nhe appears in many guises , and seduces many men and women -- in his own words , \" vanity -- by far my favorite sin \" . \nal pacino plays this role with relish , and gets to chew some delectable lines ( \" lemme givya a piece o\' inside wisdom on god . . . \" , \" i have a million names . . . \" ) , as john milton -- the devil . \nthe main idea -- that he can appear as anyone , in any form ( in this case , a buisness man ) , harkens mainly back to terry gilliam\'s the time bandits . \nbut the film , is something else , something original . \npart of what makes it so very good , is that it never takes itself too seriously -- it dabbles with morality , vanity , death , and child abuse , but doesn\'t try to become any profound study of power . \nthis is a marvelous confection -- cocky , funny , thought provoking . \nit is also entertaining . \nthere is no way you could possibly predict the ending -- it pulls back upon itself , drawing purely out of the mind\'s eye . \nthe final shot is more creative , more daring , more challenging , then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coen\'s fargo . \nthe central themes are fascinating ( sometimes reminiscent of james\' the turn of the screw , and oates\' accursed inhabitants of the house of bly ) , and the product that is built around it really wows . \nits nice to know that things like this are still being made . \n',pos
'scream 2 , like its predecessor , is a genre-crossing film . \nit is about 50\% horror film and 50\% murder mystery . \nthe mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time . \nscream was also known for its self-referential tone . \nmany inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven . \nagain , scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as \" sequels suck \" and \" the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels . \" \nscream 2\'s story is very similar to it\'s predecessor\'s . \nsidney ( neve campbell ) , having survived the killing spree in scream , is now in college . \ngale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film , called stab ( which for all practical purposes is the real-world movie scream ) . \nat the premiere of stab , two students from sidney\'s college are stabbed to death , and a new story begins . \nthe press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer . \nthey want to know all about the links between stab , sidney , and the recent murders . \nthe most complex self-reference i saw ( this should be an olympic event ) was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference . \nthe rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers . \nthe other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press . \nthe audience was watching the whole , filmed scene . \n ( whew . ) \nthe movie is packed with layers and self-references that make it a pleasure to watch . \neven better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream 2 . that\'s not to say that these references necessarily make scream 2 a deep , or even a good movie . \nthe just add to the fun of watching it . \ni recommend it for other reasons as well . \nwhat i liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural . \nno werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible . \nit is a person in a mask and a robe , his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims . \nno extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer . \nthe down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies , you have less grounds to say \" it\'s just a movie . \" \nthe whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself - gale weathers and deputy dewey ( david arquette , also from the original ) track down a killer . \nthey are likeable , but not outstanding . \nbut in combination with the horror aspect , the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint . \nit was exactly a year ago today that i wrote the review for scream . \nthe internet movie database says that scream 3 is in the works , so i wonder if i\'ll be doing the same thing on january 1 , 1999 . \nif craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high , i\'ll be happy to mark my calendar . \n',pos

'it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a less-than-savoury character as mel gibson does in payback . \nof course , if i was being paid $25 million for one month\'s work , i\'d probably be willing to take risks as well , but that\'s neither here nor there . \npayback is based on a novel by richard stark ( apparently actually donald e . westlake , author of the grifters , itself a fine crime film ) which was also filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys , lee marvin . \nthe film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back , by whom we don\'t know yet . \nall we know is that gibson , as porter , isn\'t a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back , and getting even in the process , no matter what the consequences . \nit turns out that the man he\'s after is val ( gregg henry ) , his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters . \nobviously not having much of a crisis of the soul , val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers . \nporter , however , is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet , goes about exacting revenge on the double-crossing val . \ngibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play , that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn\'t mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants . \nyou probably wouldn\'t see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat , out-of-character role such as porter ( jim carrey won\'t be doing anything like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried - the cable guy , anyone ? ) . \nharrison ford\'s idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent ; the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin , which we won\'t mention further ; and has stallone ever really played a villain at all ? \nthis is not to say that porter is a villain , per se . \nwhile he isn\'t the sort of character you wouldn\'t want to get on the wrong side of , he\'s nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their right-hand men just to prove how mean they are . \nporter is only trying to get back what is not-so-rightfully his , which in a way is almost understandable . \npayback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy-thriller which won\'t be remembered as being among gibson\'s most important work , but is still one of the finer films he\'s done . \nthe only real problem with it is that , while everything seems to work out in the end , i was left feeling something was lacking ; was that all ? \nthe ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute , and the final voice-over doesn\'t ring true , even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the film-noir style the rest of the film embodies . \nthe film just ends far too suddenly , after a huge build-up in the penultimate scenes . \na fine film , even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation . \njust be ready for a possible letdown of an ending . \n',pos
'if you thought baz luhrmann\'s radical take on _william_shakespeare\'s_romeo_+_juliet_ was wild , wait until what you see what tony award-winning stage director julie taymor ( _the_lion_king : _the_broadway_musical_ ) does to the bard\'s _titus_andronicus_ for her audacious--and very bloody--film debut . \nwhile luhrmann transplanted the star-crossed lovers to 1990s florida , taymor keeps this grisly tale of revenge in rome--but places it in a surreal temporal limbo . \nthe colosseum suggests the proper time of imperial rome , but high rises and heavy duty kitchen ovens suggest the 1990s , while the vintage automobiles and some costumes are more \'40s and \'50s , and other garments are more gladiator-like . \nas tamora , queen of goths ( jessica lange ) exacts revenge on roman general titus ( anthony hopkins ) for killing her eldest son , and he does the same to her for the wrongs she commits , taymor obviously wanted to express the timeless relevance of the story\'s underlying themes . \nhowever , the time convergence approach only works at times , for often it\'s just distracting , as in one scene where tamora\'s suviving sons ( matthew rhys and jonathan rhys meyers ) blow off steam playing video arcade games . \ntaymor didn\'t have to resort to such avant garde time tricks , for the story would have resonated just as strongly had she jettisoned them . \nshe is a strong storyteller and a master visual stylist , the latter compliment encompassing all areas , makeup and costume choices as well as those in the editing and photography departments . \nshe also has a sure way with actors ; hopkins\' titus is at once tragic and horrifying , and lange is sultry as the viperous tamora . \nthe clear standout of the cast , however , is harry lennix as aaron , a moor who is tamora\'s secret lover and a schemer in his own right . \nlennix brings great depth to a role that could have easily been played as a stock villain . \na great villain he indeed is , but to leave it at that isn\'t giving full justice to his powerful and multi-dimensional work . \n_titus_ isn\'t a complete success , but it is never less than fascinating , and it announces the arrival of a fearlessly imaginative new cinematic voice . \n',pos

'there is a striking scene early in \" city of angels , \" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise . \nthe camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black . \nthen the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up . \nyou see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch . \nit is an important scene for several reasons . \nfirst of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible . \nthe film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference . \nthere are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like \" angels in the outfield \" ( 1994 ) or \" michael \" ( 1996 ) . \nthe angels here are stark and believable . \nthis early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god\'s angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air . \nthere is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well . \nthey eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven . \nlike human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure . \n \" city of angels \" is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan ) . \nhe first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven . \nmaggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies . \nangels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it\'s not enough . \nhe wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance . \nhe learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to \" fall \" and become human . \nhe learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( \" n . y . p . d . \nblue \" ) in a touching and humorous performance . \nsitting at a diner together , franz tells cage\'s character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person\'s skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children . \nof course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it . \n \" city of angels \" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender\'s haunting 1988 film \" wings of desire . \" \nwenders\' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened . \nthe americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human . \nand , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn\'t suffer extensive damage . \nthis may be because director brad silberling ( \" casper \" ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( \" blink \" ) wanted to make \" city of angels \" its own movie - inspired by \" wings of desire , \" but not an attempt to copy it . \nand yet , \" city of angels \" is not a typical hollywood movie . \nit is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( \" the english patient \" ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world . \nseale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by . \nwhile the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are . \nboth cage and ryan give soulful , soft-spoken performances . \nryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch . \ncage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have . \nwhat is most striking about \" city of angels \" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging . \nit\'s not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time . \nit doesn\'t give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance . \ninstead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive . \n____________________________________________ visit \" charlie don\'t surf ! \" \nan eclectic collection of film reviews by james kendrick http : //www . bigfoot . com/~jimkendrick \n|| e-mail : jimkendrick@bigfoot . com \n',pos
'star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) \nreview by matt pusateri \nfew movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas\' 1977 classic , star wars . \nthe original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture . \narguably , more americans today can explain what \" the force \" or a \" jedi \" is than a budget deficit or a serb . \nso 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? \ncan a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? \nagainst this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week . \nand despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment . \nwhile the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking . \nit is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films . \nthe phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films . \nas the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) . \nthe republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation . \nthe jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo\'s young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) . \nlater , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice . \non tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts . \nqui-gon senses the child is \" unusually strong \" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be \" the one \" prophesized to \" bring balance to the force . \" \nas anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader . \ncomplicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala . \nwhile amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul . \nif the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is . \nthe phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin\'s turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy . \nbut the complexity is not overwhelming . \nthe story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode . \none of the reasons the film\'s story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused . \nit\'s unclear whose story phantom menace is . \nin the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke\'s story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight . \nbut it\'s unclear whether this new film is anakin\'s story or obi-wan\'s . \nif this trilogy is centered on anakin , it\'s a shaky foundation . \nlloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive . \non screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is \" the one . \" \nthe rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas . \nneeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight . \nmcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility . \nportman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality . \nthe biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them . \nindividually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series . \nbut unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn\'t do as good of a job playing the characters off one another . \nin star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke . \nthe ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities . \nin the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other . \nthere is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other . \nindividually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them . \nthis is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers . \nbut despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging . \nmany of the wonderful elements of lucas\' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining . \nfirst , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates . \nthe characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing \" destroyers \" on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council . \neach location is elaborate and complex . \nlucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines . \nmost of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren\'t possible when the films were made . \nmore than ever , in this new film , lucas\' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters . \nthe best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves . \nwatto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room . \nof all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable . \nspeaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks . \nwith more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas\' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy . \njar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon\'s accidental sidekick . \njar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble . \nthe animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors . \nhowever , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn\'t completely convincing . \nhe still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene . \nthroughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a \" roger rabbit \" -like presence . \nyou accept that he\'s there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character . \ninitially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film . \non my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn\'t mind him at all . \na second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates . \ndespite all the film\'s struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one\'s destiny and \" the force , \" like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously . \nfortunately , lucas hasn\'t lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art . \nfrom the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film\'s thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e . t . \nin the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed . \nand finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action . \nfrom beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil . \nthe pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed . \nthe phantom menace won\'t win any major oscars . \nit probably won\'t beat titanic\'s box office record . \nand it\'s not even the best star wars film ( i\'d put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) . \nbut it\'s an exciting and entertaining film , far better than your typical summer blockbuster . \nthe film can\'t live up to it\'s hype - no film , not even the original star wars , could have done that . \nbut it\'s still worth seeing . . . \nprobably more than once . \n',pos
'the premise is simple , if not bizarre . \na mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr . clayton forrester ) launches an average-joe ( michael j . nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made . \nwhy ? \nit\'s torturous , it\'s maniacal , and it\'s just plain fun . \nbased on the cult-favorite cable television series , mystery science theater 3000 : the movie isn\'t torturous , but as for being maniacal and just plain fun , it foots the bill quite nicely . \nmike nelson , on a dog-bone shaped spacecraft , spends his days as any young man would dream - indulging in sarcasm and horseplay , and seeing quite a few movies . \nthe catch is , these movies aren\'t the movies he chooses , but retched examples of film-making chosen specifically by dr . forrester in an attempt to break mike\'s will to live . \ndr . forrester is convinced that one too many b- movies is all it will take to ruin a man , but with a couple of wise-cracking puppet buddies ( tom servo , voiced by kevin murphy , and crow t . robot , voiced by beaulieu ) , the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema . \nthe purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known ( even if by very few of us ) to man . \nwe watch as the silhouettes of mike , tom , and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them . \nin this case , it\'s the 1954 sci-fi film this island earth . \nwe basically watch as our three leads watch , only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary . \nthe plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant , but for the sake of those who might want to know , i\'ll explain this one . \nthis island earth is the tale of two scientists , a man and a woman , who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth . \ntogether the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet . \nto make mst3k work , the film-within-the-film naturally has to be as horrible as possible , and although the tv-series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth , it\'s a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty . \nmst3k , which doesn\'t actually contain the complete this island earth , is a short 73 minutes , but this is a step very wisely taken . \nas funny as some of their observations are , it can only go so long . \noccasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously . \nalthough it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment , it\'s better than overkilling the whole concept post haste . \nmst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly , but if you don\'t know what you\'re in for , it could be a jarring disappointment . \nalthough i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars , it is a movie to be seen on home video , late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway , and with a large , saracastic crowd - new year\'s at midnight for example , which is when i saw it . \nwarning : although mst3k has more to its end credits than most ( the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun ) , they are actually more annoying than most . \nthe name slandering and asinine one-liners were extremely unfunny , and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight , it put a heavy damper on the overall experience . \nmost people will likely stay to see what the smart-alec\'s have to say , but for me , it almost ruined an otherwise good film . \n',pos
'any movie about the underground music scene is a difficult beast to master . \nany meaning found in the underground is usually lost by the dumbing-down of the experience to make it \" more accessible \" to the general public . \nor the film is produced and directed by people that have about enough understanding of the subject matter that they ought to work as production assistants for vh1 . \nhuman traffic , a new film exploring the british underground party/rave scene and the people immersed in the world of clubbing , pubbing , drugs , sex , and the beautiful , beautiful music , is an example of how it really ought to be done . \nthe film follows five brits in their young twenties during a wild weekend of parties , drugs , dancing , sex , pop culture discussions , relationships , and wanking off in front of a mirror while mum interrupts . \nthe cast of character consists of jip ( john simm ) , our narrator , who has a bit of a problem with his willy , known as mr . floppy . \nkoop ( shaun parkes ) , our black dj maestro , who has insecurity issues , afraid his girlfriend nina ( nicola reynolds ) is shagging other men . \nnina herself can\'t stand her mcjob and longs for the freedom of the weekends . \nlulu ( lorraine pilkington ) , jip\'s best mate , is tired of her cheating boyfriends . \nand moff ( danny dyer ) can\'t seem to escape the black hole of his awful life . \nthe film follows these five individuals during one weekend as each of them discovers love , friendship , and self-fulfillment , all against the raging party background . \nhuman traffic is proof that cinema can still tell us deep stories while being visually alive , as director justin kerrigan\'s subtle use of the camera lets the audience become part of the action . \nthe use of direct communication to the audience by the collection of characters works well , making the viewer the subconscious mind for the characters . \ndialogue is crisp and moves with an even pace , and the acting is confident . \nhowever , the two females leads tend to promote their relationships and dialogue with a bit of unneeded urgency that shows through when poignancy is needed . \nhuman traffic does not try to explain the rave scene . \ninstead , it gives the audience the ability to listen to the people inside it , letting you choose your own convictions about this powerful musical movement that brings together strangers , friends , and lovers for one blissful night of music and peace . \n',pos
'steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back ; he spent this time writing essays and short stories for \" the new yorker , \" several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation , pure drivel ( 1998 ) . \nmuch of the book spares tinseltown from mockery , although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview , in a fine chapter called \" in search of the wily filipino . \" \nnow , as writer and star of bowfinger , he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema , perhaps finally venting the frustrations ( \'everything being made now is crap\' ) that led to his brief retirement from hollywood . \nmartin stars as bobby bowfinger , a roger corman-wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer , quality of the projects be damned . \nhis accountant ( adam alexi-malle ) proposes a movie called \" chubby rain , \" about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops . \nbowfinger latches onto the idea immediately , and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film , based on the lie that america\'s top box office draw , kit ramsey ( murphy ) , has agreed to star . \nramsey , of course , wants nothing to do with such low-grade material , so bowfinger , on the thinking that action stars need to run , not speak , decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously . \nhe sends his cast members ( who aren\'t in on it , either ; they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co-stars ) to ramsey\'s table at restaurants , asks them to follow him in parking lots , etc . , spouting script dialogue , all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance . \nthe paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time . \nramsey is a member of mind head , a cultish self-help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities . \n ( as if that\'s not familiar enough , mind head guru terry stricter ( terence stamp ) has been dressed and combed to resemble l . ron hubbard , founder of scientology . ) \nwhen he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble \" white code \" in his face , they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat , requiring bowfinger to find a stand-in . \nmurphy will probably win more fans as jiff , ramsey\'s adorable , ignoramus double , than as kit , but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage . \nalways surrounded by an entourage , suffering from a racial inferiority complex , murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself . \nfurthermore , consider the enemies he\'ll make of popular scientologists . \npacing stricter\'s neutral-coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer , ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly . \nmurphy\'s scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta \" clearing . \" \nnot that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick ; bowfinger is steve martin\'s invention . \nhis script is surprisingly clever as satire , given that the pseudo-religion is a sitting duck , as is the entire los angeles film industry . \n ( the griffin mill-types take quite a beating , in the form of robert downey jr . as bigwig jerry renfro . ) \nmartin\'s decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder\'s point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovative-never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture . \nas expected , there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs , such as martin\'s crew of mexican border-jumpers , who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading \" cahiers du cinema , \" or martin\'s nonsensical explanation to dave , his loyal cinematographer ( jamie kennedy ) , that every movie , in the end , has a budget of two-thousand dollars ( ! ) . \nmost of bowfinger is universally funny , however ; i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski , one of our brightest comediennes , is on screen . \nbowfinger\'s main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath . \nwe\'re also asked to believe that a few simple close-ups of kit ramsey would redeem \" chubby rain , \" z-grade entertainment that would make ed wood blush . \n ( this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz\'s last directorial effort , the poorly conceived in & out . ) \nthese are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece . \nas i mentioned at the start of this review , bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather graham\'s character daisy does : hop a bus to hollywood in search of stardom . \nthat said , it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus : the sense of community between filmmakers who gel is awesome . \nmartin gets sentimental by story\'s end as he did in l . a . story , and how could he not ? \nfor those who can hack it , the movies might be the greatest business in the world . \n',pos

'how many of us would become strippers ? \nfor those of us who wouldn\'t , is it a moral reason , or purely a lack of confidence ? \nthat\'s probably not a fair question , and for a lot of us , it could very well be for neither of those reasons . \nas you watch the full monty , however , you may begin asking yourself these kinds of questions . \nwould you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in some much needed dough ? \nin case you haven\'t guessed , the full monty is about stripping , but striptease it ain\'t . \nit\'s actually quite a charming comedy that uses its ideas with a great deal of tact and sophistication . \nit is the story of six out-of-work , out-of-shape blue collar brits whose recent job losses have left the boys penniless , but not without need . \nwhat to do ? \nit hits our main character gaz ( robert carlyle ) as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis . \nit seems that simple : take it off and bring in the cash . \neventually , gaz is able to convince his friends to join him in starting their own exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance . \nthese include the overweight , confidence-lacking dave ( mark addy ) , the uptight , overly-officious gerald ( tom wilkinson ) , the once suicidal lomper ( steve huison ) , and two additional fellows who gain their place among the group by audition : horse ( paul barber ) , an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy , and guy ( hugo speer ) , a young well-endowed looker who compares himself to cary grant . \nwhen the sextet is complete , we\'re given a hefty dose of physical comedy . \nwe watch the bumbling middle-aged men choreograph pseudo-sexy dance numbers , all the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first place . \nas if there anti-appeal wasn\'t enough , they decide to boost interest in the group by promising \" the full monty \" on opening night , which for us americans , means baring it all . \n . \n . \nand i mean * all * . \nthe movie actually ends on opening night ; a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add . \nit\'s sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you leave the theater . \nwith the subject matter , you might not expect the fully monty to be such a feel-good , almost inspiring film , but it surprisingly turns out that way . \nthe amount of light , touching drama also comes as a nice surprise , never feeling off-balance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of the film . \nthere\'s a lot more to this movie than you might think in other words , and the ensemble cast couldn\'t be better . \neach character is completely individual , interesting , funny , and most importantly , real . \nthe full monty is never offensive , a very impressive attribute since its subject matter alone could\'ve easily fallen prey to tastelessness . \nit\'s one of those movies that is best described as a solid piece of entertainment , perfect for a great night on the town , or as a saturday night movie rental . \neither way you see it , it shouldn\'t let you down in the slightest . \nand , pun heavily intended , when it\'s all said and done , you\'ll be smiling from cheek to cheek . \n',pos

'books could be , and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy , and rightfully so . \nthis is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70s/early 80s , inspiring literally dozens of clones , from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day , and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre . \nthe special effects were groundbreaking , revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later . \nliterally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it . \nand now , george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy . \nmuch has been and is still being made of the fact that mr . lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now . \nsome fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection , while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday\'s star wars updated with today\'s special effects wizardry . \neither way , the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen , where it rightfully deserves to be seen . \ncan there be anyone in the world who doesn\'t know what star wars is about ? \nin a way , star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it . \nit\'s a story about a young man\'s coming of age , a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire , a tale of swashbuckling and derring-do the likes of which haven\'t been seen on the silver screen in decades , strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn , and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world . \nit\'s high adventure , incredible special effects , and . . . well , it\'s just an _experience_ . \nsomething about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation . . . and \nit\'s about to do so again . \nthis new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film\'s devoted fans , who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now . \ninterviews , trailers , leaks from within lucasfilm . . . all of these have been collected , collated , and placed on webpages for people to see ( pages such as http : //www . islandnet . com/~corona/films/details/sw4 . html \nor , my personal favorite , http : //leopard . cs . latrobe . edu . au/~koukoula/ \n ) . \npictures of before and after have been placed side by side . . . even \nmonths before the movies were released , fans were making comparisons . \nin some cases , the changes were nothing less than phenomenal , and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater . \nthe digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here , unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original . \nfor instance , in my personal favorite example , the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep , moss-covered carvings and etchings . \nand mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling , booming city , with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing . \nall the starships and fighters are now computer-animated , getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made--and they look _fantastic_ . \nfour and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added , including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldn\'t do it justice . \nhowever , much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself . \nthe negatives , badly damaged by the ravages of time , were brightened and returned to their original splendor . \nthe audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed , with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt , into glorious , booming , theater-shaking full-thx dolby digital stereo . \nand _that_ , more than the added scenes or new special effects , is where the real value of this new version lies . \nit\'s really true what they say in the commercials : star wars loses _so much_ on the small screen . \neven letterboxing doesn\'t make up for the decrease in size and definition . \nin regard to the star wars special edition , and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released , i\'ll make this final recommendation : go and see it . \ngo and see it more than once . . . it \nmay be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after it\'s gone this time . \ntake along the youngsters who\'ve never had the big-screen star wars experience--you\'ll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time . \nthere\'s magic in this movie--special edition or no , there can be no denying that it\'s still star wars , and still has the power to thrill and enthrall children of all ages , from four to four hundred . \nlet\'s all return to that time long ago , and that galaxy far , far away . . . \n',pos
'eddie murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career . \nknown for his notorious late 80\'s slump , murphy has still managed to bounce back with a handful of hits in the past few years . \nwith the exception of the dreadful holy man , he appears to be on pace for a full-fledged comeback . \nlife was a great move on the part of murphy and co-star martin lawrence , because it\'s a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slap-sticky drivel . \ndirector ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own , and doesn\'t insert a distracting plot to back them up . \nlife is , in a sense , one great balancing act with murphy on one end and lawrence on the other . \namazingly , the scale never tips in either\'s favor due to the marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other . \nas the movie opens , we\'re introduced to ray gibson ( eddie murphy ) , a two-timing pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club . \nthere he meets a successful businessman named claude banks ( martin lawrence ) . \nsomehow , after multiple contrivances , the mismatched pair find themselves on their way to mississippi on a moonshine run . \nwhen all is said and done , ray and claude have been framed for a murder that was actually committed by the town sheriff . \nhence the setting of life : mississippi state prison , where the main characters come to realize their unlikely friendship is important , and become set on finding an fool-proof escape plan . \nthe film takes us from the 30\'s all the way to the 90\'s , presenting a difficult task in showing how the aging process affects ray and claude . \nluckily , rick baker handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic , academy award caliber manner . \nnot only do we believe the characters look as if they\'re 90 years old , but they sound like it , too . \nmurphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles , even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards . \nthis is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up it\'s sleeve . \nwhile the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy , there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it\'s core . \nbut the comedic aspects work wonderfully , wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars . \nthe movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama , but in both senses , it\'s an overwhelming delight . \ni could say a few bad things about the movie , but i don\'t want to . \nit\'s such a nice surprise , such a great vehicle for eddie murphy and martin lawrence , that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll . \n',pos
'cinematically speaking , gordon parks\' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film . \na bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman\'s \" black private dick that\'s a sex machine to all the chicks \" to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking . \nyet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , \" blaxploitation , \" died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness . \nthe reason for this is the same one that explains the film\'s connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft . \nwhile the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass . \nthis fact also explains why john singleton\'s y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is . \nmuch like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_\'s plot doesn\'t score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers . \ncontrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff . \nthe star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972\'s _shaft\'s_big_score ! _ and 1973\'s _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city . \nhowever , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors . \nwhen a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p . i . \nbut that\'s easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime . \npeoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson\'s way toward commanding this film . \npeoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages . \nhowever , he isn\'t so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples\' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming ) . \nit\'s no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that\'s exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless . \nthen again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson\'s impressive star turn doesn\'t quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars . \nbale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot-on . \ncollette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane . \nbusta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft\'s sidekick rasaan . \nregistering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno . \n ( jackson also has little to \" do \" in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn\'t even have one sex scene . ) \nthat singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he\'s not really an action director . \nthis is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases . \nthey move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it\'s just that there\'s nothing terribly inventive about them . \nthese set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they\'re unsurprising and conventional . \nbut if there\'s anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it\'s make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive . \nfrom the slick title sequence--scored , of course , to isaac hayes\' ever-infectious oscar-winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film--on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado . \neven a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary . \nstyle doesn\'t exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that\'s of little consequence . \nwhat matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth . \n',pos
'uncompromising french director robert bresson\'s \" lancelot of the lake \" achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory\'s \" morte darthur . \" \ninstead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table , it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak , ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous , bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them . \nchivalry has no place in \" lancelot of the lake , \" except as that of a dying ideal . \nbresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning , decimated , after failing merlin\'s command to retrieve the holy grail , the mystical cup that was filled with christ\'s blood . \nbresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure . \nthe opening sequence is a series of clumsy , disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked off , a stomach is impaled , a skull is split open , skeletal remains hang from trees , and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house . \nsince the film starts with camelot in near-ruin , and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion , it doesn\'t carry the grand , tragic resonance of other arthurian films . \nwe never get to see camelot at the peak of its power , therefore there is no real downfall to witness . \nbut , then again , it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film . \nrather , it is lancelot , and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart , than the external downfall of a kingdom . \nlancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales , and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh . \nthe greatest of all knights , he was flawed only in his love for arthur\'s wife , queen guinevere , and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot . \neven when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere ( laura duke condominas ) , he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment . \nhe knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom , but he is powerless in his passion . \nwhen sir mordred ( patrick bernhard ) accuses lancelot of the affair , other knights , including sir gawain ( humbert balsan ) spring to lancelot\'s defense . \nit is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table ; the flesh wins out over the spirit , and the consequences are dire . \nbresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men\'s hearts and minds . \n \" lancelot of the lake \" is filled with his particular trademarks : a stripped-down , minimalist style , flat , expressionless dialogue , and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music . \nhe uses background music only twice in the film , during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits . \nthe music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes , but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film\'s thematic elements : the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor , the neighing of horses , the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads , and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest . \nlike most of his other films , bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless , flat voices . \nall the actors he used in \" lancelot of the lake \" had never acted before , and with the exception of patrick bernhard , they never acted again . \nnever once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word . \ninstead of using vocal inflection , bresson strove to create emotion through images . \nin some ways , this technique works ; in other ways , it doesn\'t . \nthe final montage of arthur\'s men battling each other is quite marvelous , and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap-pile sums up the entire film in one moment . \nhowever , other times bresson\'s uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable . \nfor instance , during an important jousting contest , bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses\' legs . \nhe does this repeatedly , opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag . \nwhile there might be symbolic value in this , the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome . \nnevertheless , \" lancelot of the lake \" is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker . \nbresson\'s style may not be for everyone , but one has to respect his strength as an artist . \nby re-evaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own , he turns \" lancelot of the lake \" into something rare in modern cinema : a truly personal film . \n',pos

'the calendar year has not even reached its midway point , but that hasn\'t prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscar-bait season . \nbille august\'s high-profile adaptation of victor hugo\'s classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic--handsome production values , strong performances by a top-notch cast , a literate screenplay--with one critically missing element : emotional sweep . \nfor those not familiar with hugo\'s original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired , the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a 19th-century french-set version of the fugitive . \nafter serving 19 years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread , the brutish jean valjean ( liam neeson ) is paroled . \nimmediately upon release , he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night ; he is caught by authorities , only to be forgiven by the bishop , who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow . \nthat he does , and in doing so breaks his parole , which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) , who was one of the guards in valjean\'s prison camp , on his trail . \nthematically , however , les miserables is a story about redemption , which valjean finds through his dealings with two women , the hard-luck factory-worker-turned-prostitute fantine ( uma thurman ) , and her illegitimate daughter , cosette . \nyears after breaking parole , valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau , where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert . \nvaljean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette ( mimi newman ) from her cruel caretakers , the thenardiers , and raise the child as his own . \nthe \" father \" and \" daughter \" eventually land in paris , where the teenage cosette ( claire danes ) falls for dashing student revolutionary marius ( hans matheson ) . \nthe decades-spanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of , and the danish august turns in his most accomplished english-language work , following the underrated 1994 superstar soap the house of the spirits and last year\'s stylish but highly preposterous mystery smilla\'s sense of snow . \nhe and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at a brisk pace . \nproduction designer anna asp , costume designer gabriella pescucci , and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast . \nneeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable ; rush\'s finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated , oscar-winning theatrics in shine ; and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role . \nthe younger members of the cast fare less well . \ndanes is convincing as cosette , but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction ; and matheson , while competent , is a less interesting robert sean leonard . \nas technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is , by the time les miserables was over , my emotions had only been superficially involved . \nwhile i was touched by valjean\'s relationships with fantine and cosette , i was not moved . \nnot even reaching the \" touching \" level is the cosette-marius pairing . \nmy only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical ( as i am sure many others\' is ) , and i was dismayed to see eponine , a friend of marius\'s who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him , almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation ( the daughter of the thenardiers , here she is only briefly seen as a child ) . \nher presence would have added some much-needed conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance , but i suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine ( fantine ) was enough . \neven so , as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season , les miserables is a thoughtful , well-made , entertaining film , one that will sate moviegoers hungry for a dose of drama before popcorn no-brainers invade the multiplex . \n',pos

'the latest epos from lars is a blast , although a rather moody one . \nthis lovestory is situated in a small town in the rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotland in the 1970 something . \nthe church ( calvinistic ) is so strict that the church bells has been removed from the clocktower , they are considered being too unrestrained . \nin these surroundings we find the to-be-weds jan and bess , played by stellan skarsgaard and the remarkable new movie actress emily watson . \njan is on leave from the oilrig and bess . . \nis just bess , a bit naive and innocent ( in every aspect of the word ) , at first . \nat the wedding party we are told an anecdote , illustrating her infinite kindness , she once lend a bike to an stranger , her best friends bike however . \nbut bess is suffering in this scary religious society . \nwe soon take part in a funeral where a man , fallen off the orthodox path , is laid to rest while doomed to hell . \nwomen are not allowed to attend funerals or speak up in the church . \nwhen the end of the honeymoon approaches we see bess idolizing jan in such an intend , almost manic , that her friends try to calm her down a bit . \nthe time has come when jan is to return to the rig , bess is falling into the darkness of depression , her yelling of grief and sorrow are heard above the breaking of the waves . \nshe can\'t stand the thought of life without her husband . \nwe witness her dialogues with god ( she speaks both parts , paranoia ? ) \nconvincing god to return jan from the oilrig , and her prayers are heard . \nan accident on the rig bring him back , paralysed from the neck and down . \nnow he can\'t satisfy her need for physical love , he try to persuade her into finding a lover , with the ulterior motive to make her describe these affairs to him in every detail . \nat first she resist , but her love for jan and his assurance that this will make him recover more rapidly make her comply . \nimagine what this is doing to the poor girl ? \nthe story is cleverly divided into eight chapters parted by beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby , accompanied by music from the era ; procol harum , deep purple , t-rex and others . \nthe use of hand-held camera and lack of any make-up make the characters solid and help to separate this movie from others in the sentimental genre . \nthe incredible performance from the actors makes the movie brilliant , though a bit too gloomy for my taste . \ni would say that it is in the genre of betty blue ( 37 . 2 le matin ) and bitter moon ( lunes de fiel ) . \nemily watson as bess and katrin cartlidge as her best friend dodo deliver outstanding performances , this must be the reason for giving it the \" grand prix du jury \" in cannes this year ( although we had hoped for the \" palme d\'or \" ) . \nthe screenplay is now available in print , the transformation being made in the period from ultimo may to july , just in time for the danish premiere . \n',pos
'anastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases . . . \n ( especially hercules ) . . . \nemotion . \nall the wacky characters voiced by celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences aren\'t going to hold anyone\'s interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together . \nnot since disney\'s beauty & the beast has there been such a compelling animated film with interesting characters and drama that works . \nthe story of the romanov family , the rulers of russia , and their downfall begins the film . \nanastasia , one of the daughters , narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin ( voiced by christopher lloyd ) with her grandmother ( voiced by angela landsbury ) . \nbut anastasia gets lost , and grows up with no memory of her royal origins . \nthe grandmother lives in paris , hoping to someday find her beloved anastasia , the only member of the family to survive the russian revolution . \na young woman named anya ( voiced by meg ryan ) runs across dimitri ( john cusack ) and vlad ( kelsey grammar ) , who are trying to put together a scheme to create an anastasia to fool the grandmother and get the reward money . \nthey pick anya to pose as their princes , and of course , it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia . \ndimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is a commoner , and meanwhile , rasputin is not dead , and plots his revenge against the last romanov . \nthe plot is actually quite well structured . \nthere are a lot of complexities that may have to be explained to the kids later , but it moves along fast enough that they\'ll never have time to be bored . \nwhat this really means is that the adults won\'t be bored by it either . \nthere is a great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny , and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses . \nthere is , of course , lots of comedy for the kids , including rasputin\'s pet bat , bartok ( hank azaria ) , who is easily the funniest thing in the film . \nhowever , the comical scenes never distract from the drama , but are worked into the plot almost seamlessly . \nthe animation is gorgeous - the characters seem to come to life through the talented animators . \nnot since beauty & the beast have animated characters had so much life to them . \neven without the voices , they act . \nthe musical number in paris is a show-stopper , with some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style . \nas with all recent animated features , there are songs , however , these songs do more than just provide fodder for top-40 singers to get on the radio ( although there are three of them during the end credits ) . \nthe songs are all very catchy , and advance the plot , instead of just being showpieces ( except for the paris number , but that\'s so much fun , it\'s okay . . . ) . \ni can\'t reccomend anastasia highly enough . \nit\'s a wonderful film that ranks right up there with other animated classics . \nkids and adults alike will enjoy it , and it\'s also nice to have a quality animated feature film from another studio besides disney . \n',pos
'i can hear the question already . \nwhat on earth do these two movies have in common ? \nto most people , not a lot , except that both are by renowned directors . \nas i saw them , however , both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers . \nbut oh , how differently the packages affect their films . \nwhile \" everyone\'s \" production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special , jane campion\'s imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones\' script is . \ni left \" everyone says i love you \" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face . \ni left \" the portrait of a lady \" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , and i could have cared less . \n \" everyone \" features nothing allen hasn\'t done before storywise . \nwoody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman ( roberts ) , and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong--again . \nsimilar situations happen to his family and friends . \nsome of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his \" early , funny \" films . \nthe scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of \" take the money and run , \" his directorial debut . \nhowever , nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one-of-a-kind display of sheer good spirits . \nin fact , in this movie , the feeling itself is what\'s most important . \nyes , the movie would have been better--among his very best , i think--if it had a meatier story . \nbut what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling . \nand what better way to express feeling than through music ? \nlove is often best expressed in a song , and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart . \nsome are a tad too goofy , such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor , but i admired allen for even putting them in there . \nit also helps that as usual , allen has a top-flight cast working with him . \ntheir singing voices range from quite good ( goldie hawn ) to not quite good ( allen ) to literally unlistenable ( barrymore , whose real voice was dubbed by a professional ) . \nbut while their vocal abilities differ , all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen , and making it rub off on the audience . \ngranted , some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies , but for those attuned to it , this film should work wonders . \njane campion , too , has a top-flight cast working for her in \" portrait of a lady , \" too , but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted , virtually lifeless mess , albeit a visually interesting one . \ncampion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eye-filling images that linger in the mind . \nunfortunately , what didn\'t linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting . \ni remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman , but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people . \neven worse , i don\'t find myself feeling bad that i\'ve forgotten . \nthe problem , i think , lies not with the cast , which seemed to be trying very hard for the material . \nit was the script that couldn\'t convince me to care about anyone . \nthe characters were putting out all kinds of emotion , but i found no reason to connect with any of them . \ni understood that the story was about cold , emotionally vacant characters , but for me to care about them , i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives . \njones\' script never simply gave me that opportunity . \nin the end , it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes . \nunfortunately , as she kept painting these dazzling pictures , they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film . \nin the end , the movie\'s one strength ended up hurting it . \nso here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots , and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them . \nwhy ? \nwith both films , my head cared about neither story , but only \" everyone says i love you \" was able to make my heart sing . \n',pos
'you\'ve got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk . \nthe title is generic . \nit\'s meaningless . \nand i can\'t believe it\'s good business . \nwhen you pick up the phone and dial 777-film , how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean-claude van damme movie , the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot , is called , geez , maximum risk ? \nyuck . \nthe movie itself deserves your attention . \nfor sweet bloody thrills , this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands-down . \nonly mission : impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller , and i\'ll give maximum risk the edge simply because it\'s not as slick as the tom cruise picture , and therefore more gratifying in its execution . \nmuch to my surprise , van damme continues to develop as a pleasant , unpretentious action hero . \nhis track record isn\'t as solid as schwarzenegger\'s , but he\'s a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold . \nin 1993 , van damme worked with hong kong\'s premier hardcore action director , john woo , on a fairly lame movie called hard target . \n ( if you can find a bootleg copy , woo\'s radically different director\'s cut is much better than what was eventually released . ) \nthis follow-up is directed by ringo lam ( city on fire , full contact ) , whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo\'s more operatic offerings . \nthe surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo\'s subsequent broken arrow . \nhere\'s the rundown . \nvan damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend ( jean-hugues anglade ) finds a corpse that\'s alain\'s exact double . \nturns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother , michael , who has been killed by some russian heavies ( and some strangely american looking cops ) . \nalain does some investigating . \nhe finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city , and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia . \nassuming michael\'s identity , alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael\'s girlfriend ( natasha henstridge ) , the fbi , and the russian mob in little odessa . \nthat\'s as much as you need to know . \nthe story is adequate , but not overly involving -- and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice , just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment . \nthere\'s a love story , too , but i didn\'t find it terribly convincing , partly because ex-model henstridge is too high-strung in her high-profile debut ( she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species ) . \nshe\'s great to look at , and she can certainly read a line , but what she does here can\'t really be described as \" acting . \" \nof course , \" acting \" isn\'t really what she was hired for ( i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme\'s ) . \nthe movie is exceptionally violent , bordering on gratuity . \n ( keep that in mind when planning your date . ) \nthe stunts are spectacular , and the fact that you can spot van damme\'s stand-in makes his work no less impressive . \nthere\'s only so much you can do with a car wreck , but this movie makes crisp , effective use of pile-ups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies . \nand lam has a surprising , innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action . \nthe main difference between lam and woo , i believe , is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces , lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and double-barreled points of view to make things run . \ndon\'t get me wrong -- when chow yun-fat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woo\'s hard-boiled , it\'s an amazing moment . \nbut it\'s a moment that\'s hard to reproduce in hollywood . \n ( for one thing , hollywood doesn\'t yet have chow yun-fat ! ) \nwhile woo\'s hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart , maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture . \nthe very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city , but lam\'s use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on . \nthe film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lam\'s shooting style , accentuating rather than amplifying the action . \nthe performances could have used some fine tuning ( in particular , there\'s an annoying , overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely ) , and the movie doesn\'t always overcome the limitations of its genre . \nthe story is a little mundane , although there are some effective moments involving van damme\'s unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had . \nbut it\'s not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture , and it\'s doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity . \nvan damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man\'s best movie , and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong kong/hollywood hybrid . \n',pos
'in many ways , \" twotg \" does for tough-guy movies what la confidential did for police stories . \nthere\'s savviness in its writing and a mature patience in allowing the material to unfold . \nbut , i suppose , we wouldn\'t expect less from christopher mcquarrie , who was responsible for giving us \" the usual suspects \" . \nhis writing talents are still in tact as he brings to us a bloody yet intellectual tale of two unabashed but dimwitted thugs and a plan gone awry . \nthe two goons are parker and longbaugh ( ryan phillipe and benicio del toro ) . \nthese two men show the hardened wear of those who have always had it tough . \ntheir troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive . \ngiven the choice of minimum wage or petty crime , they\'ll always choose the latter . \nyet , they are incredibly foolish planners . \nactually , these two never really have a plan . \nthey just improvise along the way , hoping that their bravado and arsenal of guns will take care of anything that they might have overlooked . \ntheir next scheme , which they cook up about as fast as a mcdonald\'s burger , is to kidnap some surrogate mother named robin ( juliette lewis ) that was hired by some well-to-do family . \nif all goes well , they\'ll receive a nice bit of ransom money and life goes on . \nwhat parker and longbaugh do not realize is that robin is carrying a baby for the chidduck family , whose patriarch is a feared crime boss . \nmoreover , two bodyguards ( nicky katt and taye diggs ) constantly escort her . \nthese two protectors find an eerie sense of pleasure when being confronted and tested in life and death situations . \nthey would rather die than fail ; thus their bravado level is equally high . \nbut it seems that the testosterone levels of parker and longbaugh are a bit higher , and they employ some unusual but fun-to-watch tactics to pull off the kidnapping and to outrun the pursuers in a sort of slow-motion car chase down a series of alleyways . \nthe next hour or so , we watch the chidduck camp regroup and assess their situation . \nduring this time , additional plot lines come into play and more and more details are revealed . \nbecause the chidduck\'s can not go to the police and because of the special circumstances involving the kidnapping , we are introduced to more characters that will help to influence the outcome . \nwe discover that not everyone in the chidduck camp is loyal to the cause . \nas a result , there are undercurrents of a conspiracy , and elements of betrayal and subterfuge . \nthe sepia-toned atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks to a terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings , shrills of intrigue and crescendos that tell us of life and death situations that are about to occur . \nthe momentum and the coolness of the film , however , begins to fizzle in the last 30 minutes , which featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try to make their way off with the ransom money . \nyou can expect lots of bloodletting and an odd denouement . \nin fact , you may admire this film more than you like it . \nyet , for the most part , \" the way of the gun \" stays on target . \nit feels cool with its elements of conspiracy and gunplay , and smart for its invective dialogue and tough guy poetry . \n',pos

'is it just me , or have disney films gradually lost their appeal ? \ni was almost stunned by the quality of \" who framed roger rabbit ? \" , a fun , unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together . \n \" the little mermaid \" harkened back to , and perhaps surpassed , the classic disney animations from the first half of the century . \nhowever , the endless stream of \" the little mermaid \" wanna-be\'s is getting to me . \nyou know the spiel : a lame plot recycled from some well-known story , colorful , almost psychedelic animation , the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson , the comedic sidekick/sidekicks , the seemingly unattainable love interest , a few catchy songs , a few in-jokes for adults , and the occasional out of place warner-brothers-coyote-fall-off-the-cliff type joke . \nit\'s a formula , and like any formula , it gets tiresome . \nthat\'s why i\'m delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli , a japanese cartoon studio . \nfrom what i\'ve seen of their movies ( \" kiki\'s delivery service \" and the already english-dubbed and american- distributed \" my neighbor totoro \" ) , foreign audiences are in for a treat . \nthese movies , particularly \" kiki\'s delivery service , \" are wonderfully original and entertaining . \n \" kiki\'s delivery service \" starts with an unusual premise : kiki , upon hearing forecasts of clear skies , decides it is time for her to leave home . \nthis is unusual because kiki isn\'t a college student or a young adult making her start on the world , but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch . \nher mother is also a witch , and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training , her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance . \njust the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences , but no mention is made of the occult , and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie : kiki\'s mother acts as a village doctor , and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom . \nkiki must choose a city to move to , and what she chooses is the co-star of the movie : a german seaport town , far removed from the country life she has been used to . \ninitially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding , she\'s discouraged , and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch . \non the verge of leaving for a new town , she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it . \nthe favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier , a one-persons delivery service . \nthis is where the movie becomes shockingly good . \nkiki\'s job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her . \nthe townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn\'t seem forced or artificial , but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light . \nthey\'re three- dimensional , impossible to quickly evaluate , possessing of faults , and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl . \nhowever , each one has something about them , some interest or trait , that makes them interesting and unique . \nthe personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings : the seaport town genuinely looks impressive , capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the 1950\'s . \nthis beauty is beauty with depth ; for every detail left in , dozens are only hinted at . \ni could probably go on all day , but i won\'t ; suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie . \nsome of my favorites are kiki\'s relationship with the baker\'s husband : although he\'s quiet , never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie , and he initially scares her , his kindness wins her friendship . \nin the garage of a deliveree\'s house can be found a vintage model t . two old ladies have a relationship evolving from master-servant to friend-friend . \nsuch details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg . \nadded on top of this is a lesson on the importance of self-worth . \nkiki initially seems to derive much of her self-worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her , but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment , making her question the importance of such beauty . \nthis causes kiki to lose faith in herself . \nhowever , kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings , but the innate beauty inside her . \nseeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous , and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i don\'t even want to hint at it . \nthe ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and , ironically , the most disney-esque moment i\'ve ever seen ; if you don\'t hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention . \nthe movie steers free of many of the disney conventions : there is no violence , however cartoonish , no song-and-dance number , and kiki\'s pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick , although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes . \nhowever , i would be surprised if disney doesn\'t give jiji more jokes , or at least the voice of some comedian . \nrefreshingly enough , the moral lesson of the movie is not self-contradicted , a habit disney movies have gotten into . \n \" beauty and the beast \" \'s beautiful belle , for instance , learned that beauty was derived from a person\'s inside , and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing . \nkiki , on the other hand , learns to separate her wardrobe from her self-image , and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film . \nanother difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for \" kiki\'s delivery service \" : not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be , but with a greater attention to realism and detail , it fits the movie to a t . this is particularly true with scenes of kiki\'s flights . \nthe extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold , and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film i\'ve ever seen . \ni\'m not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states . \ndisney tentatively plans a theater release of \" monoko hime \" shortly following the summer \'97 japanese release , and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that . \ni\'d guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release . \nalthough the wait is unfortunate , it\'s good to know that it\'s being released at all , for \" kiki\'s delivery service \" is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release . \nwatch this movie . \nalong with \" man bites dog , \" and perhaps something by woody allen , this is the best movie i\'ve ever seen . \n',pos
'insane ( but inspired ) musical about alferd packer , the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america . \nas the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer ( trey parker ) supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of gold . \nthroughout , packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse , a tribe of `ute\' indians that doesn\'t seem quite on the mark , and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism . \nparker obviously knows his musicals very well , because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film ( he would accomplish this again in his post-cannibal ! \nmusical motion picture , south park : bigger , longer , and uncut ) . \napart from the inherent interest of seeing a pre- \" south park \" parker and stone in their first effort , cannibal ! \nalso offers up some pretty decent laughs . \nthe aforementioned `ute\' indian tribe that packer\'s group encounters is a definite highlight , as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen ( one of which ends on a comedically deadly note ) . \nstone\'s humphrey character steals the show , especially when complaining about the prospect of having to `eat butt\' or revealing what\'s underneath his muff cap . \njason mchugh\'s character of mr . miller is the stand out performance though , as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings . \nas i mentioned before , parker\'s songs are very catchy . \nyou\'ll be hard pressed to get `it\'s a shpadoinkle day\' out of your head once you\'ve heard it ( incidentally , the braniff logo that appears at the end of every \" south park \" episode is scored with a few notes from this song ) . \nother songs you\'ll find yourself humming include `when i was on top of you\' ( a love ballad ) , `the trapper\'s song\' ( the villains leit motif ) , and `hang the bastard\' ( the rousing finale ) . \nthankfully , none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park : bigger , longer & uncut\'s songs are . \nreleased as a pick-up through troma studios , the film is available on videocassette and dvd . \nthe videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman , discussing his admiration for parker and stone and the fact that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film ( which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball ) . \nthere are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films . \nas for the dvd . . . \nwell , that\'s a different story . \nprobably one of the best dvd packages of the year ( and potentially of all time ) , cannibal ! \nthe musical ! \nthe dvd is a massive achievement . \npresented in 1 . 33 : 1 ( full frame ) only , the disc has the usual troma inclusions : the tour of troma , the troma intelligence test 2 , trailers for upcoming releases , but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal ! \nspecific extras . \nthe first thing i must note is , the transfer is about as beautiful as any i\'ve ever seen on any disc . \nthe picture is crisp , clear , and free from any noticeable artifacts . \nadd to that one of the funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard , featuring trey parker , matt stone , jason mchugh , dian bachar , and andy kemler getting drunker and drunker as the track continues and you still haven\'t scratched the surface of the extras . \nthere\'s also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of the film , a clip with trey , matt , and lemmy ( of the band motorhead ) from the film terror firmer , an index for easy location of all of the songs in the film , and finally , an index of all the songs as performed by the cast of a stage production of cannibal ! . \nit\'s good to see this film finally get the treatment it deserves . \nkudos to the entire production staff at troma and aix for making one of the most entertaining dvds i have seen in a very long time . \n',pos
'allen , star of many a brian depalma movie in the early eighties , has a brief , throwaway part towards the end of \" out of sight , \" as the maid of a crooked financier . \nin keeping with her past performances , allen wears little more than a green velvet victoria\'s secret ensemble which begs the question , did they really need a costume designer for this ? \n \" out of sight \" is not likely to secure ms . allen the kind of plaudits bestowed upon pam grier , who likewise returned from out of obscurity to appear in another recent elmore leonard adaptation , \" jackie brown , \" but it is intriguing to see her name kicking off the \" also starring \" credits given her limited screen time . \nthe real stars of \" out of sight \" are george clooney ( \" batman & robin \" by way of \" e . r . \" ) and jennifer lopez ( \" selena \" ) , whose winning chemistry , coupled with steven soderbergh\'s freeze-frame directorial technique , help the film retain the charismatic charm of leonard\'s original work . \nwith the success of \" get shorty \" three years ago , filmmakers have realized that adapting an elmore leonard novel can be an easier proposition than trying to dream up a storyline from scratch . \nin \" out of sight , \" clooney stars as jack foley , a career criminal who specializes in unarmed robbery--he just waltzes into banks and politely makes a withdrawal , claiming that his \" partner \" ( just another customer it so happens ) will shoot the manager if the teller doesn\'t comply . \nfor all of jack\'s nice-guy charm though , he\'s not very lucky . \nhis latest scam lands him in florida\'s glades correctional facility . \nfederal marshal karen sisco ( lopez ) coincidentally arrives at the prison just as jack and his buddy ( ving rhames , typically appealing ) are breaking out . \nthere\'s a brief struggle and jack bundles himself and karen into the trunk of the getaway car . \nit\'s in these cramped confines , pressed intimately together , that jack and karen start falling for one another . \nthe mutual attraction continues as the couple on opposite sides of the law slip in and out of one another\'s grasp . \nkaren follows jack to detroit , where he\'s about to pull off another heist , this time a cache of uncut diamonds from incarcerated businessman richard ripley ( played by a toupee-sporting albert brooks , almost unrecognizable in the prison scenes ) . \nit\'s during this final caper-gone-awry that allen makes her scant appearance . \nclooney\'s range as an actor is limited , but he has undeniable charm . \nlopez , too , is easy on the eyes , but she demonstrates more depth in her portrayal of karen , a tough yet tender professional . \nshe dispenses with hit men as easily as she out-maneuvers sleazy pick-up artists in a bar . \nespecially cute is a sequence in which karen fantasizes about jack in a motel bathtub . \nadmirably supporting clooney and lopez are don cheadle as fellow felon maurice \'snoopy\' miller , steve zahn as the perennially stoned glenn michaels , and dennis farina as karen\'s dad , who affectionately buys her a piece . \nadd a couple of uncredited cameos from \" jackie brown \" cast members and \" out of sight \" proves to be a lot of fun . \nnot as hip and clever as \" shorty , \" perhaps , or as complex and colorful as \" brown , \" but loads of fun nonetheless . \n',pos
'synopsis : in phantom menace the galaxy is divided into power groups whose interests will inevitably collide in later sequels . \nthere is an overarching galactic united nations-type organization called the senate presided by a weak chancellor . \nwithin the senate two camps are at odds : a bickering , isolationist alliance called the republic and their aggressive rival the trade federation . \npreserving law and order are a council of jedi knights who are meanwhile searching for a prophesied chosen one of virgin birth . \nmanipulating events behind the scenes is a dangerous , reemerging clan called the dark lords of sith , so shadowy and secretive that they comprise a \" phantom \" menace . \njedi knight qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) witness an invasion of teenage queen amidala\'s home planet naboo and befriend a gungan named jar jar ( ahmed best ) . \non the desert planet of tatooine the two jedi , jar jar , and amidala ( natalie portman ) attend a lengthy drag race involving the young boy anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . \nthe five protagonists try to solicit help for freeing naboo by visiting the city planet of coruscant where a lot of debate and political maneuvering takes place . \ncan they free amidala\'s helpless planet ? \nopinion : on tv last night i watched young , wannabe celebs pay $400 a ticket and come running out of theaters to bask in front of news cameras , gushing with testimonials of the phantom menace\'s greatness in exchange for a few seconds of being on national television . \ngiven this kind of media mania i wondered if phantom menace , the most anticipated movie of 1999 , could possibly live up to the extraordinary hype that preceded it . \ndoes phantom menace match the exaggerated hype ? \ndirector george lucas answers , \" it\'s only a movie . \" \nto me , any movie with russian-sounding accents for bad guys , jamaican accents for good guys , and middle eastern-sounding accents for seedy gamblers accents can be expected to be more tongue in cheek than profound . \nvisually , star wars : episode i --the phantom menace ( 1999 ) is a kid show where parents can take their young ones to marvel at child-friendly cgi characters and wondrous backdrops even if the character dialogue ( mostly geopolitics ) is beyond the level of children . \nit is left to parents to patiently explain the conversation : droid origins , family lineage , the definitions of terms like blockade , appeasement , federation , alliance , symbiosis , satellite-controlled robots et cetera . \nat least this much is clear : there\'s plenty of eye candy , and in the last few minutes it\'s good guys and joe camel lookalikes versus a caped , horned red devil character and his mechanical hordes . \nweaknesses : weaknesses lie in the writing and in the performance . \nat first it seems like the film is to be an invasion story , but then phantom takes an hour-long detour to cover one chariot race before returning to the invasion theme . \nthis dilutes the central story . \nadditionally , smaller scenes seem written self consciously , as if they were added more to fill us in on extraneous background information for other movies rather than form an integral part of the present movie . \nveteran actors liam neeson and ewan mcgregor noticeably outperform the other acting leads . \nbetter ensemble chemistry between the five leads and background information that is central to a tight story line could have made have given phantom stronger performances and storytelling punch . \nstrengths : on the bright side phantom menace as a big-budget production is far ahead of the competition in terms of making whimsical creatures , worlds and vehicles appear real . \nthe film boasts sophisticated , top-of-the-line visuals and quality exotic costumes , a musical score entertaining enough to stand alone , and three worthwhile sequences in the second half . \nbottom line ? \nseeing the film is entertaining and informative , like a visual theme park with star wars filler information serving as dialogue between impressive money shots . \nwe are bound to be completely inundated by star wars publicity , music and tie-ins for the next few months . \n',pos
'at one point during brian de palma\'s crime epic scarface , the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to a ranting al pacino and pops a question that the audience has no doubt been wanting to ask for themselves : \" can\'t you stop saying \'fuck\' all the time ? \" \nfucking good question , that . \nit may not be an honour that instills the filmmakers with pride , but as far as i can tell oliver stone\'s script contains the said expletitive more times than any other film in cinema history . \nyet it would be a shame if bad language is all de palma\'s scarface is remembered for , because this is a damn fine gangstar flick . \nthe overall structure is similar to howard hawks\' 1932 original , but this time the scene has switched to miami , florida and our anti-hero\'s chosen vice is cocaine traffiking . \npacino , sporting a thick cuban accent , gives one the best performances of his career ( golden globe nominated ) as tony montana , a cuban refugee with a criminal past who flees castro and comes to america to live the american dream . \nand live it out he does , with lashings of violence , abuse , murder and the funny white powder . \nfrom his earliest jobs as a drug runner for various middlemen , tony montana makes it clear to everyone he meets that he\'s not a man to be fucked ( sorry ) . \nsoon he\'s the king of the cocaine heap , but his hot head and an increasingly out of control drug addiction prove his undoing . \n \" never do your own stash \" , warns one character early in the film . \nas sure as night follows day , the emperor of miami eventually falls . \nwriter oliver stone and director brian de palma make an explosive combination here . \nstone\'s script offers solid storytelling and some fine character development . \nmontana is fascinating ; uneducated but calculating , a straight shooter who speaks from the heart ; an ambitious , violent man yet one with a conscience . \na man fiercely protective of his beautiful 20 year old sister , not wanting her to be sucked into the glitzy , dangerous world which he inhabits . \npacino is dynamite , taking to the role with a brooding , bristling energy which in his more recent films has often degenerated into just simple overracting . \npfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole with no inner life . \nonly once does tony express real affection for her and his desire to have children , and even then you sense all he really wants is a regular screw and a beautiful object to show off to his friends , and she\'s happy to oblige . \nthis isn\'t as meaty a role for pfieffer as sharon stone\'s was in casino , but its an effective one nonetheless and she aquits herself well . \nas director , de palma sets up a number of dramatic scenes with his typical stylistic brauva . \nthe escalating tension he creates in various mob situations - a drug deal gone wrong , an assination attempt - is often thrilling , and in this respect he is every bit the equal of scorese and coppola . \nwhere he differs from , say , coppola\'s godfather trilogy is in his overall treatment . \ncoppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep , whereas in scarface de palma opts for a grittier feel . \nand it perfectly suits the material . \nthe only major botch is giorgio moroder\'s mostly crap synthesier score . \nit\'s just not right , and unfortunately compromises the impact of some otherwise good scenes . \nas expected , scarface is very violent at times , but you shouldn\'t be watching gangster movies if that upsets you . \nat over two and a half hours in length it\'s a true epic , and if you\'re a fan of the genre you\'ll love f * * k-filled minute of it . \n',pos

'i like movies with albert brooks , and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks . \nlost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies . \nhis humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today , inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator . \nyou will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film , while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent \" talk films \" which are finding their way into theaters . \nthe situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can\'t , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh . \nteenagers and jim carrey fans probably won\'t find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will . \nput simply , brooks\' comedy is intelligent . \nmother is albert brooks\' latest film , and it does not disappoint . \nbrooks plays john henderson , a middle-aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce . \nhe makes an attempt at dating , but fails miserably . \nhe then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) , a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life . \njeff has a good job , a loving family , and most of all , a warm relationship with their mother beatrice ( debbie reynolds ) . \nafter dinner , john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice , and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky-dory the dialog is . \nin comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her . \nat the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john\'s life , she says , \" i love you , \" and john replies with , \" i know you think you do . \" \nthe thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading . \nit\'s the kind that goes something like , \" yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but . . . . \" \nit seems as though nothing he does makes her happy . \nthere\'s always the big but . \njohn believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner . \nhe comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is . \n \" a great experiment \" , he calls it . \nbrooks\' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother . \nthere\'s a scene where john has just arrived at his mother\'s house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the \" great experiment \" , beatrice asks , \" now explain to me again why you don\'t want to stay at a hotel . \" \nshe still doesn\'t get it , and it is absolutely hilarious . \nin the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh . \nshe apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over . \nwhen john points out the ice on the sherbet , beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze . \n \" you\'ve named the ice ? \" \nasks john . \nhe\'s also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator , such as a twenty-pound block of cheese . \n \" the freezer was a good invention , \" says john , \" but it\'s not supposed to be used for everything . \nthat\'s why it\'s smaller than the refrigerator . \" \nit\'s something most of us find strangely familiar . \nbrooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur . \nfor example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep\'s characters are in a comedy club having a discussion . \nwhen they\'re finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , \" and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside ! \" \nyou don\'t know what the joke was because you couldn\'t hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context . \nin this film , brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene . \ni don\'t want to give them away , but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past . \njohn\'s purpose for staying with his mother is to learn , and we as the audience learn right along with him . \nhis mother is not the fascinating type to begin with , but as john spends more time with her , we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth . \nwatching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way . \non screen , brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character : you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world . \nin a way , he\'s very much like yosarian of catch-22 , expect with something of an attitude . \ncasting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect . \nshe assumes the part with ease , even moving and speaking a little slowly , and is just so adorable it\'s hard to get mad at her character . \nthis only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her . \nas his first choice , brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice , but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband , who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer\'s disease . \nthat may be just as well , since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely . \nrob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother\'s favorite and , for all his success in his job and family , is slowly exposed as a mama\'s boy . \nthe only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes . \na solid connection is not really made between john\'s troubles and his reasons for living with his mother . \nadditionally , the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals , and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting , how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this ? : \nbeatrice : you must think i\'m some kind of moron . \njohn : no , i think your someone who thinks i\'m a moron . \nbeatrice : well , it takes one to know one . \n',pos
' ( note : there are spoilers regarding the film\'s climax ; the election , of course ) \nwe see matthew broderick , a man torn to a primal state ; he\'s been unfaithful to his wife , lied to and manipulated his students , and by the same token they\'ve demeaned his masculinity , his self-respect , his desperate attempt at changing the world . \nand yet , he equates the cause of his pain , his torment , with tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) . \nno matter how many students have come and gone , and disappointed him as an educator , she\'s the real threat . \nabout to give in , and divulge that she\'s won by only a lone vote , broderick\'s mccalister turns in defeat , sees tracy\'s euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says , \'no\' . \nthe fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men , no matter how obscure , have in their relationships ; a traditional expectation of success , to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry . \nshe can\'t go higher than him . \nhe won\'t allow it . \nand what\'s amazing about \" election \" is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor . \nearly in the film we learn that tracy was romantically , and then sexually , involved with a now departed teacher . \nit\'s like payne and taylor , his co-screenwriter , have taken tracy , a girl desperate for friendship , loyalty , and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers , that they found sitting at the teachers\' lunch table more fitting , to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist . \nand it\'s amazing the compassion that we have ; it seems so real to us , and not merely because it\'s happened before , splashed all over the front pages , but , because of the all around \" nice \" persona of these people , we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters . \nit\'s with mandy barnett\'s \" if you\'ll be the teacher \" playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most ; a final , viscous injection of bittersweet irony . \nsexuality , though , is not the only basis for payne\'s satire , or its success . \nit also makes a telling point about politics , friendship , and class boundaries . \nsatire is required ( or ought to be , anyway ) to take itself seriously , or act so , while the audience does not . \nit\'s a fine line to straddle , but some films ignore it altogether ( \" drop dead gorgeous \" leaps infuriatingly to mind ) . \npayne and taylor hit the right chord ; their characters are real people : neither is perfect , but rather both of the leads are flawed , misguided individuals who retain , somewhat , noble intentions at heart . \nwe sympathize with them , but still , as a satire , their idiosyncratic behavior , and their wrongdoing , is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle , but also reflect and meditate , about . \nminus half a point , though , for payne admitting not to having seen \" ferris bueller\'s day off \" . \nwhatever . \n',pos
'martin scorsese\'s films used to intimidate me . \nbecause of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks . \nas much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something . \ni learned from scorsese\'s casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story . \nno mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies . \nfor example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other . \nthere was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on . \nor toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building . \nagain , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing . \ni don\'t mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking . \nbut he simply uses the best tool for the job . \nit shouldn\'t have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward . \nthe movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet . \nthe movie\'s title is another name for the dalai lama which means \" ocean of wisdom . \" \nhis story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story . \n ( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film\'s opening shot and watch where it is repeated . ) \nwe first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old . \nhis curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama . \na test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before . \nseveral items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items . \nthe child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own . \nthe boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama . \nscorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk . \nbefore selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation . \nsometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice . \neither way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader . \n>from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama\'s spirit and the future leader of a nation . \nit is a great weight to put on the mind of a child . \nin the u . s . it might be grounds for a call to social services . \nbut the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage . \nneither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well-rounded person . \ncertain patterns take shape over the years . \nfor example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology . \nradios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys . \nwhen he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet . \nhe also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals . \nit\'s nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter . \nbut the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet\'s gigantic neighbor , china . \ntibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china , as , first the propaganda , then the political pressure , and finally the armies , come across their common border . \nthe chinese invasion is so successful that the lama\'s life is in danger if he stays . \nthe movie ends when , after much agonizing , the dalai lama leaves tibet for india . \nthe story doesn\'t lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do . \nit just doesn\'t fit that mold . \nif it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie ( perhaps more like seven years in tibet , which is good in its own right ) . \nthe pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that . \nthe structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events , not vice-versa . \nperhaps because the pace is slower , we have more time to notice the beautiful art , vestments , and architecture of tibet . \na mandala , ( tibetan sand painting ) with beautiful , vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie . \nthe robes and hats of state are bright red and gold . \nthe bricks are a rich reddish brown , not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans . \neven the touchstone pictures logo before the movie ( which is usually light blue ) is the red and gold of tibet . \nphilip glass composed the music for kundun , and he was the perfect choice . \nfor those who don\'t know of glass , his music is like a tibetan mandala . \nhis building blocks are lots of small notes , tiny grains of music , which are first grouped , then repeated in patterns . \nthese patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition . \npeople won\'t be flocking to kundun for it\'s great ending , or talking about its outstanding plot , but it does have a lot to offer : an interesting lifetime , exotic sights , rich cinematography , and innovative music . \nit gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person . \non top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese , who gives the film a strong , beautiful , consistent look .

'robert redford\'s a river runs through it is not a film i watch often . \nit is a masterpiece -- one of the better films of recent years . \nuntil 1994 , it was my second favorite film of all time . \nthe acting and direction is top-notch -- never sappy , always touching . \na friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because \" i was afraid it would just be really politically correct , and tick me off . \" \nall i could do was tell him to go in unbiased , and enjoy . \nit is one of the few movies that has completely reduced me to tears . \nbut certain memories should not often be rereleased -- in the last few shots , you have to cry . \nupon my first viewing i left bawling . \nit is not flawless -- but it is so very good , that you can\'t help but be effected . \nthe opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental -- watching these shots of people who have been dead so long , gives you a feeling of perspective and history observation that you will find in very few other films . \nmartin scorsese once described the movies as a dream state -- like taking dope , and immersing yourself in an alternative world . \nthat is what a river runs through it does . \nit exploits the unique power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self . \nboth times i\'ve seen it , its been hard ( again to quote scorsese ) waking up . \nbut the dream is lovely . \n',pos
'richard gere is not one of my favorite actors . \nhowever , i like courtroom dramas , and this film looked good enough to take a chance on . \ni wasn\'t disappointed . \nit wasn\'t a great film , but it was interesting , and took several unexpected turns . \none thing : what\'s with the title ? \nnot only is it extremely forgettable , it doesn\'t really have much to do with the film , as far as i could determine . \nin the long run , it will probably hurt the film , as people won\'t be able to think of or remember it . \nmartin vail ( richard gere ) is a grandiose defense attorney . \nhe loves the money and the fame that go along with defending ( successfully ) rich scum , such as mafia men and drug-dealers . \nonce he sees that the accused killer of a prominent chicago archbishop is a baby-faced alter boy , he wants in on the case , presumably for the press he\'ll get . \nwe soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is a former lover , janet venable ( laura linney ) . \nvail himself is a former prosecutor , and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney , played very well by john mahoney ( frasier\'s father on the tv series ) . \nthere is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie : people have public faces , and private faces . \nwe see this in the murdered archbishop , in the accused , and , most strongly , defense attorney martin vail . \nrichard gere does a fairly good job . \nat first , he appears to be a money- and attention-grabbing lawyer , with no consideration of the truth . \nbut we see another side , as he becomes a seeker of justice , and comes to believe in his client . \nalfre woodard , as the judge , is capable , though somewhat wasted in a standard role . \nlaura linney also does journeyman work ; nothing spectacular , but acceptable . \nher relationship with vail is believable ; their verbal fencing adds to the film . \nthe actor who playes vail\'s investigator ( unfortunately , i don\'t remember his name ) is quite good . \nhis female assistant ( she looked very familiar , but i can\'t remember where i\'ve seen her ) was also capable , but unspectacular . \nthe best performance in the film was by edward norton . \nhe was excellent , as the timid altar-boy turned alleged \" butcher boy of st . mike\'s \" . \ni was impressed by the depth of the plot ; there are red-herrings , and dead-ends , that in a lesser film would lead to a predictable ending . \ni liked the plot twists the film took , and most of the supporting characters , thus i give primal fear a respectable b+ rating . \n',pos
' \" when you get out of jail , you can kill him . \" \nstarring ashley judd , tommy lee jones , bruce greenwood . \nrated r . \ndouble jeopardy is a lurid , prepostrous thriller that\'s also one of the year\'s most enjoyable . \nit\'s an uncompromisingly brutal , cheerfully anarchic , hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it . \nthere is not a moment here when the events on screen don\'t have a direct bearing on the plot ; once the film gets going it never stops . \nit has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and that\'s probably a correct assessment of the plot , but the film itself has little in common with the 1993 andrew davis/harrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones . \nnot even bothering with character introduction , director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the get-go and never finds the brake . \nwe meet , rather hastily , libby and nick parsons ( ashley judd and bruce greenwood , respectively ) a seemingly happy married couple , with a son matty , age 4 . they go out on a sailboat one night , and after a period of some rockin\' sex , they go to sleep . \nlibby hears a strange noise , wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood . \nshe follows a red trail to the upper deck , where she finds a knife and , out of astonishment , picks it up . \nat that convenient moment , the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested . \nher lawyer , a friend , puts up a defense in court , but though we know she is innocent , the evidence against her is too compelling . \nher friend adopts her son and she goes to prison . \nonce in prison , she makes a phone call to her friend . \nher friend gives her son the phone . \nnick walks in the room . \nlittle matty screams \" daddy ! \" \nthe phone goes dead . \nlibby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isn\'t even dead . \nshe gets some advice from a prisoner/former lawyer , who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband , they can\'t convict her of the same crime again , meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they can\'t touch her . \nafter a weirdly short amount of time , she gets out of parole . \nshe is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees , under the command of parole officer travis lehman ( tommy lee jones ) . \nshe sets out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back , which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated . \nshe winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her son\'s \" adopter \" . \ndouble jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false . \nthe law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime : same time , same place , same circumstances . \nit\'s not like it matters . \nthis is a rollickingly good thriller ; intense , exciting , fast and furious . \nit\'s silly alright , but this is the kind of film you just don\'t question . \nin some films , plausibility is everything . \ndouble jeopardy , however , is not concerned with making sense : its sole purpose is to entertain , and it does . \njudd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role . \nthis is her breakout box-office performance , and she is terrific . \nshe brings some emotion to what could have been a one-dimensional role , giving the movie a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set pieces . \ntommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for which he won an oscar in the fugitive , but the movie makes good use of his stone-faced wit . \nthankfully , too , double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby and travis ; a subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the film\'s story . \nthis is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys , and i took a sort of sick pleasure in that . \nthe sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful , as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book . \nafter all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops , deft fbi agents and the virtues of the american legal system , it\'s great to see a movie that doesn\'t so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure . \ndouble jeopardy is really good , but it isn\'t the kind of good that is remembered or recognized with awards . \nit\'s one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off , otherwise , your brain will be busy ruining your experience . \nthis is a thriller that isn\'t concerned with being smart or plausible . \ninstead it diverts all attention to the action , which , this year , is second to none . \n',pos
'let\'s say you live at the end of an airport runway . \nlarge jetliners continuously pass over your house , rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace . \nlet\'s say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances , and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home . \nnow let\'s say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway , and offers you more than it\'s worth . \nwouldn\'t you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed ? \nof course you would . \nbut what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise , and the house your castle ? \nthat\'s what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he\'s happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home , sorry , it\'s not for sale . \nunfortunately , the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government , which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice . \nnot about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back . \nthe castle , an australian comedy by rob sitch , is perhaps one of the simplest movies i\'ve seen in recent memory , yet also one of the funniest . \nin fact , it is this film\'s reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful . \nthe good guys and the bad guys are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets . \nit\'s the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn\'t have to think all that much while watching this film . \ni just sat back and enjoyed myself . \nthe situation is one we\'ve seen before : regular joe fights back against the government , or big business , or whatever . \nwhat makes this film different is its characters . \ndarryl thinks he\'s got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind , he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he\'s got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny ) , and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard . \nsteve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for \" investments \" like jousting sticks and overhead projectors , while wayne kerrigan is in jail , as a result of dennis denuto\'s incompetent courtroom maneuvers . \nthe great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren\'t so stupid that they get annoying . \nthey\'re just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing . \nwe look upon them with a little bit of pity , but a whole lot of affection . \nscreenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans . \nsympathy for their situation , the laughter they bring us , and the family\'s wonderful characterization , simple as it may be , leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them . \ni suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans , but trust me , it works . \ni particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs . \ndon\'t get me wrong - slapstick , when executed well , can be genius . \nit\'s just that too often , a film will resort to it\'s use as a shortcut to amusing the audience , not always successfully . \ninstead , the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world . \nwhen they are by themselves , the are funny , and when they are with normal people , they are hilarious . \none of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though . \nthe kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film\'s running time . \nluckily , it\'s a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film\'s main drive , is still quite enjoyable . \nwith all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes . \ni\'m not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate . \nand , for that matter , it\'s more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this . \n',pos

' \" no man is an island , \" one character quotes john donne in apt pupil , effectively summarizing the movie\'s themes . \nwhile hardly a great film , singer\'s ambitious adaptation of king\'s short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it . \napt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses . \n1984 . wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again . \nbowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd\'s theory . \nbowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden\'s intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view . \nthe stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todd\'s desire for gory details overrides his repulsion . \nbowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii . \nmarching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his \" student \" , among other things . \nbowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship . \ndussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future . \nall of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material\'s excessive climax . \nsinger has yet to get keyser s ? ze out of his system . \nhis the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal\'s tics and todd\'s golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals . \napt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway . \nthankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects\' film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system . \nsome scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer\'s handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training . \nmckellan\'s and renfro\'s performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan\'s finely-tuned realization , i\'d like to single out renfro\'s daring work . \nhe isn\'t afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldn\'t do . \n ( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thomas in the same role ? ) \nrenfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine-i hope he doesn\'t continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him . \nas guidance counsellor edward french , \" friend \" schwimmer also deserves mention . \nhe wants to be the parent to todd that todd\'s own well-to-do folks are not ( todd , like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupil\'s blackening-heart even more apparent . \nbut one of the film\'s ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous . \nno man is an island , indeed-we all have the capacity to make the \" right \" or the \" wrong \" choices . \nschwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible . \n-october , 1998 \n * the excellent collection king\'s stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil , but the shawshank redemption ( originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption ) and stand by me ( originally titled the body ) . \n',pos
'i rented this movie with very high hopes . \nthis movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 , and unfortunately , was not as good as i hoped , but was still very intriguing and thought provoking . \nfirst of all , the casting for this film is great . \ntobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood . \nthey play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly . \nwith a plot as unbelievable as this film , you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast . \ntobey and reese ( bud and mary sue parker ) play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability . \nwilliam h . macy , an actor i have grown to love over the past year , turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife , a \" colored \" person and his friends , the \" non-colored \" ones . \nhe also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife . \nhe does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood . \njoan allen is equally great as betty parker , the ideal tv mom . \nher character is the most ambitious . \nshe is very na ? ve , and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that . \nher lack of chemistry with macy , which the role calls for , and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific , and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast , then this film would even been even better . \nas said before , jeff daniels gives a bad performance . \nhis character displays the change going on throughout the town , yet he does not display it with enough conviction . \nhis character is very confusing and he is not very believable . \nthis film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance . \nthe movie is very provocative . \nit challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today . \ni really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up , but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing . \nthey demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch , but do it in a slow pace . \nthe only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length . \nsome films are not meant to be that long . \npleasantville is one of those films . \nthis film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it . \nfirst , they are amazed by the implementation of color . \nthen they want to have it . \nthen they do not want to . \nthen the war ensues between the colored and non-colored . \nthis is all strung out over two hours , which was way too long . \nsome movies need a lot of time . \nsaving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time . \nthis film is only two hours long , and seems much longer . \nlength is everything in films . \nif you can nail down the perfect timing and pace , you can win half the battle . \npleasantville can move at a good pace at times , but it is not consistent enough . \noverall , pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days . \ni went in expecting a light-hearted film about change . \ni left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change . \nluckily , pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audiences . \nonly if it could have done in a shorter amount of time . \n',pos
'few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parker\'s adaptation of frank mccourt\'s memoir angela\'s ashes . \nmany dismissed it as an humorless , sentimentalized , uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel ; others hailed it as a heartfelt , sincere portrait of the human spirit . \ni\'m somewhere in between , leaning strongly towards the latter . \nit\'s certainly well-made and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be . \nbut i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams \" i\'m important ! \" \nmccourt\'s book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900\'s , a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us . \nas he comments , \" we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty . \" \nin ireland , frank ( played by joe breen as a small child ) , his 3 brothers , his mother angela ( emily watson ) and his father malachy ( robert carlyle ) get financial help from angela\'s mother , a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman . \nshe helps them get a rat-infested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job . \npositions are scarce and when he does finally find one , he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking . \nmeanwhile , frank goes to an uptight catholic school , where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires . \ntwo of frank\'s brothers soon die , crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition . \nas if the poverty and the suffering weren\'t intense enough as it stood , malachy and angela have another baby , worsening the situation further . \ni imagine this doesn\'t sound like much of a plot . \nthat\'s probably because it isn\'t one . \nthese are people . \nthis is their story . \ndirector alan parker ( the commitments ) knows how to tell a good story and angela\'s ashes , despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting . \nthough the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting , it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue . \nsupplementing parker\'s able direction are the engaging , often poignant performances of the leads , some of them seasoned thespians , others relative beginners . \ncarlyle , the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama , perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character . \nwe empathize with the guy , but we don\'t like or admire him . \nemily watson turns in a heartfelt , sincere supporting performance . \nit is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats . \nalso worthy of mention is little joe breen , whose face graces the film\'s superb poster . \nit is breen\'s first feature film and he\'s extraordinary as young frank . \nnot unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense , you can peer into the character\'s soul through breen\'s sad eyes . \non the flip side , one thing that could have vastly improved angela\'s ashes is a more decisive editor . \nwhile gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery , he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage . \nthe first half , especially , could have been trimmed down , bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process . \nthings pick up at about the halfway point , sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour , but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co . set in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary . \n * spoiler warning ! \nskip next paragraph if in suspense ! * \nthe film\'s final message is somewhat conflicted , as frankie , in effect , leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back to america . \nwhat , exactly , are we supposed to make of that ? \nhis mother doesn\'t seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son , as any mother would , but it still seems inconsiderate of him . \ni haven\'t read the book , but i\'m sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein ; therefore , i\'m suspicious . \nanother thing that\'s never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title , which , i\'m sure , is also explained in the memoir . \nif seen as a film onto itself , rather than an adaptation , angela\'s ashes stands tall . \ndespite a few minor setbacks , it is a captivating story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the financial ladder . \n',pos

'this has been an extraordinary year for australian films . \n \" shine \" has just scooped the pool at the australian film institute awards , picking up best film , best actor , best director etc . to that we can add the gritty \" life \" ( the anguish , courage and friendship of a group of male prisoners in the hiv-positive section of a jail ) and \" love and other catastrophes \" ( a low budget gem about straight and gay love on and near a university campus ) . \ni can\'t recall a year in which such a rich and varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia . \n \" shine \" was one bookend . \nstand by for the other one : \" dead heart \" . \n>from the opening credits the theme of division is established . \nthe cast credits have clear and distinct lines separating their first and last names . \nbryan | brown . \nin a desert settlement , hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town , there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby . \nthe local police officer has the task of enforcing \" white man\'s justice \" to the aboriginals . \nthese are people with a proud 40 , 000 year heritage behind them . \nnaturally , this includes their own system of justice ; key to which is \" payback \" . \nan eye for an eye . \nrevenge . \nusually extracted by the spearing through of the recipient\'s thigh . \nbrown , as the officer , manages quite well to keep the balance . \nhe admits that he has to \'bend the rules\' a bit , including actively encouraging at least one brutal \" payback \" . \n ( be warned that this scene , near the start , is not for the squeamish ) . \nthe local priest - an aboriginal , but in the \" white fellas \" church - has a foot on either side of the line . \nhe is , figuratively and literally , in both camps . \nernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle . \nhe is part churchman and part politician . \nhowever the tension , like the heat , flies and dust , is always there . \nwhilst her husband - the local teacher - is in church , white lady kate ( milliken ) and her aborginal friend tony , ( pedersen ) have gone off into the hills . \nhe takes her to a sacred site , even today strictly men-only . \nshe appears to not know this . \ntony tells her that this is a special place , an initiation place . \nhe then makes love to her , surrounded by ancient rock art . \nthe community finds out about this sacrilegious act and it\'s payback time . \nthe fuse is lit and the brittle inter-racial peace is shattered . \neveryone is affected in the fall out . \nto say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film . \nsuffice to say it\'s a rewarding experience . \nbryan brown , acting and co-producing , is the pivotal character . \nhis officer is real , human and therefore flawed . \nbrown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man , then suddenly feel angry about him . \nit wasn\'t long ago that i visited central australia - ayers rock ( uluru ) and alice springs - for the first time . \nthe wide-screen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures it\'s vicious beauty , but never deteriorates into a moving slide show , in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground . \nthe cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film ; from the western to the birdcage . \nat least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people and the line between them and we anglo-saxon \'invaders\' : \" jedda \" , \" the chant of jimmie blacksmith \" and \" the last wave \" . \nin a year when the race \'debate\' has reared up in australia , it is nourishing to see such an intelligent , non-judgemental film as \" dead heart \" . \nthe aboriginal priest best sums this up . \nhe is asked to say if he is a \" black fella or white fella \" . \n',pos
'i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files . \nfirst , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . \nthe producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable . \nyou have to reach for a larger audience . \ntherefore , the movie is quite user-friendly . \naltough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange . \nbut fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on . \nyou will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera . \nin any case , the answer is no . \ni am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium . \nhowever , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie\'s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie . \ni taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new . \neverything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others . \ni know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie . \nwarning : major spoilers follow ! \nplease do not read to fully enjoy this movie , you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird \" hummm \" sound is all about . \nyou have been warned . \nthe x-files is what a summer should be . \nexciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances . \nthis is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank . \nfrom start to finish , this movie does not let go of you . \nwhen i compare it with last summer\'s movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon . \nthis flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . \nin fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue . \nyou might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! \nthe last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . \nyou know , when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? \nso yeah , the x-files is scary . \nand guess what ? \nyou never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster . \ndo not think that the x-files is a monster movie . \nin fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . \nno , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series . \nscully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . \nshe has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . \nno , this is mulder\'s time in the spotlight . \nby now , you have heard of the scene where mulder \" showers \" independence day . \nif you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let\'s just say that due to recent events mulder should be \" showering \" godzilla instead . \nto those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who \ncares ! ? \nif he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? \nthe dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous . \nthe camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . \nthe script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose . \nif you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! \nunlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects . \nmiss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense . \nalso , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don\'t ! \nthe person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation . \nthere is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? \n ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . \nwho needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a \" big emotional scene \" between godzilla attacks ? \nso far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i\'d recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose . \nbut the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is . \nwhat more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? \ncool effects ? \nit\'s got some . \npulse pounding ? \nhell yes ! \nstrangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time . \nit does not provide answers to the show\'s many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together . \nrating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many \" whoah , i never saw that one coming ! \" \nmoments , four \" holy shit , where the hell did that come from \" and one heck of an ending . \nyou may wonder where this movie lost half a star . \nwell , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop . \nit\'s pretty obvious the film\'s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving . \n',pos

'i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials , but there isn\'t . \ngeorge lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant , special effects-bound flicks and he has done it again . \nthis is the first star wars film i\'ve seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video . \nwhat is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story , but its amazing visuals . \nbasically , the film\'s plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets . \nqui-gon ( liam neeson ) and his young apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) set out with the animated jar-jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war . \nwhen their ship breaks down and they are stranded , they find a young boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his slave mother . \nqui-gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing . \nanakin participates in a heart-pounding podrace , one of the highlights of the film , to get the equipment needed to fix qui-gon\'s ship . \nhowever , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy . \nmeanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit\'s end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders . \nthere are hardly any emotional scenes in the film- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb . \nthis does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made . \nin all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes . \ndespite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without flaws . \nfor starters , we have the ill-conceived , moronic character jar-jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience . \nwhat a klutz ! \ngeorge lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2-d2 , or c3-po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain . \nsecondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie\'s atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic-book feel of the previous three star wars installments . \nthis is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie\'s plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here . \nthe movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions . \ni can\'t say much about the acting , though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway . \nhowever , there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances- they are straightforward and , at times , stale . \nnatalie portman has a great presence , but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic , unfeeling ? enigma . \nthere is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance . \njake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk . \ndespite the inevitable faults , there is so much to enjoy about the movie . \nthe heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn\'t quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes , but they are amazing and edge-of-your-seat fun in their own rite . \nthe film is a treasure to look at . \nthe visual effects are astonishing 99 . 8\% of the time- the awe-inspiring , mouth-opening , eye-popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius . \nnot since 1997\'s the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one . \nthe production design is reminiscent of the fifth element , the previous star wars movies , kubrick\'s 2001 , maybe even of fritz lang\'s classic silent metropolis . \nhowever , all the sets are so original . \nthe original star wars movies can\'t even match the grandeur of this film\'s visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer- it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode . \nthe costumes are remarkable and have jean-paul gaultier written all over them . \nwhether its queen amadala\'s gigantic wardrobe complete with gold-embroidery and feathers , or the jedis\' simple brown uniforms , the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness . \nthe costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie . \nas for john williams\' score , i don\'t think he\'s done one as complex or powerful since ? i can\'t even remember . \nit is as epic as his schindler\'s list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws . \nit includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films , but williams has added on , made the music much more intense and moving . \nwhat with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie , one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed . \nthere is very little to hate in the film : it\'s a very accomplished and skillfully made flick . \nit is the best \" fun \" film and the best big-budget film out today , most definitely . \n',pos
'lisa cholodenko\'s \" high art , \" is an intelligent , quiet drama . \nits strongest quality , aside from the top-notch central performances , is the perceptive way in which the film , also written by cholodenko , observes its characters . \nthey are all flawed people , some more troubled than others , but they are not judged . \njudging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers\' parts , because no one , no matter how bad off they are , deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of . \nsyd ( radha mitchell ) , a 24-year-old woman living with her longtime boyfriend james ( gabriel mann ) , has recently been awarded an ideal job at the high-profile photography magazine , \" frame . \" \nshe very much enjoys where her career is headed , but is often not taken very seriously by her managers , who are always giving her petty jobs to do , when she knows she could be doing more important things . \none night , while taking a bath , syd notices a leak coming from the apartment above hers , so when she goes up there to inform them of it , she meets lucy beliner ( ally sheedy ) , a thin , worn-out , and unhappy woman , who lives with her drug-addicted german girlfriend , greta ( patricia clarkson ) , a pathetic former actress who is usually so out-of-it that she often is in and out of conciousness . \nsyd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy , and discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before . \nlucy claims she doesn\'t want to get back into the profession , but syd manages to convince the \" frame \" editors to do a piece on her work . \nall the while , syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy , even though she has never previously been attracted to a woman , and lucy starts a battle with her personal demons . \n \" high art , \" is such an effective motion picture because it is never suger-coated or idealized , but instead an honest and convincing portrait of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere , while syd\'s luck begins to rise . \nthe film in no way is about lesbianism , but about love , which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality . \nas lucy and syd grow closer and closer together , we really do believe that they are falling in love with each other , even if the relationship might be doomed . \nwith this picture , ally sheedy\'s star has risen once again , thanks to her touching , nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy , a woman who , in the course of a decade , has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs , which has taken away her once-blossoming career . \nher characted really is tragic , and one particular scene involving lucy and her mother , in which lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem , and her mother matter-of-factly responds by saying she can\'t help her , is heartbreaking . \nalthough not autobiographical , sheedy has had drug problems in her past , and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucy\'s footsteps to her role . \nalso very good is radha mitchell as syd , who previously starred in the slight 1997 australian comedy , \" love and other catastrophes , \" wh caught me by surprise with her performance . \neasily being able to pass as christina ricci\'s older sister , mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently . \nas accurate as almost every detail is in , \" high art , \" i wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd and james , who , played by gabriel mann , is left with a throwaway role . \nby the time he finds out about syd and lucy , he disappears from the film , and i wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other . \nthis is a very minor fault , however , in a film that is full of riches . \nalthough many of the characters are stuck in a hopeless pit of despair , syd and lucy are intelligent people who recognize their problems . \nthe character of dominique ( anh duong ) , the \" frame \" editor who decides to give syd a chance with her ideas , was also written to be far more mature than expected . \nand the one sex scene in the film was beautifully and originally done . \nfor once , it did not invlove steaminess , or violent sexual activity , or gratuitous nudity , but focused on the actual characters , who love each other , and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex . \n \" high art , \" which won the screenwriting award at the 1998 sundance film festival , marks the superior feature film debut of cholodenko , as well as sheedy\'s strongest , and best , role to date . \n',pos
'the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster \nthe big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman \nthe most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider . \nwhen those observers are joel and ethan coen , the surreal becomes bizarre . \nwhen the life is that of jeff \" the dude \" leboswki , the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of \" what\'sgoingonaroundhere \" . \nthe marvelous sound of \" the stranger \" ( sam elliot ) \'s voice-over introduces the film . \nat least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up . \nthe dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the \" laziest man in los angeles , possibly the world \" , although he\'s not so much slothful as he is relaxed . \nspending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn\'t have much of a life , but he\'s having a good time . \nwhen asked what he does for fun , he responds \" bowl , drive around and the occasional acid flashback \" . \nlebowski\'s passion is bowling . \nwhen he\'s not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him . \narriving home one night , he\'s beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them . \neven worse , they urinate on his rug . \nthe problem is that the dude doesn\'t have a wife . \nhis assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment . \nthe \" big \" lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionaire and his dudeness lives in two-room squalor . \nthe next day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake\'s mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug . \nthe carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it\'s virtually the only object there . \nwhen he\'s denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor . \non his way out , he runs into lebowski\'s trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who offers to perform a sexual act that , according to rumor , is one of bill clinton\'s favorites for a thousand bucks . \nthe penniless dude wisecracks that he\'s heading for the cash machine . \nlater he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny\'s kidnappers . \nthis begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes-gone-wrong sequences . \nthe kidnappers are impossibly inept . \nthe dude and his cronies are even worse . \nevery plan goes awry . \nyou can almost see lebowski\'s brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues . \nthat\'s the story , but to tell the truth it doesn\'t much matter . \nthere could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining . \nthe narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into . \nthe dude\'s bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you\'d see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they\'re not quite what they seem . \nwalter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties . \neverything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam . \nwhen a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won\'t admit it , walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet . \ndonny gets precious few words in between walter\'s screaming and the dude\'s rambling . \nwhen he does , walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns . \ndonny is \" out of his league \" and doesn\'t \" have a frame of reference \" . \nthe film is peppered with people for whom the term \" character \" would be an understatement . \nthe big lebowski\'s daughter maude , an avant-garde \" vaginal \" artist , paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s&m mary martin . \nthe kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers . \nbunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star . \nmost impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler . \nas the flamenco music swells , we see him putting on his lavender hose . \nthe camera pans up to an all-purple skin-tight bowling outfit with \" jesus \" ( pronounced with a \" j \" , not an \" h \" ) embroidered on the pocket . \nhe addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail . \nhis tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball . \nbridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has . \ni can\'t think of anyone else who could have done a better job . \nbuscemi has a limited role , but he plays it perfectly . \nthe more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he\'s one of the treasures of our time . \nit\'s odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr\'s television husband . \nmore like the coen\'s \" raising arizona \" than their hit \" fargo \" , \" the big lebowski \"

'i don\'t box with kid gloves . \ni don\'t play nice , i\'m not a nice guy , and i never , ever , go easy on a film . \ni consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic . \nhowever , i do some favors , and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery . \nrigormortis , the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking , gets several of these points each time . \ni still , however , will not go easy on them . \nthey recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy ( which begins , quite wittily , with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film . ) and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it . \nin the famous lines of many martyrs , i have no regrets . \nwell , i do have some regrets , but that is not the point in the previous sentence . \nthe point of it was that down with america was a film that , from a critical standpoint , did not entirely disappoint me . \nsure , the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain , and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films , but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable . \ndown with america concerns a government agent , needless murder , and a book containing everything from the unabomber\'s manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report . \nlike the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed , it displays an off-kilter humor and intelligence ? it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail . \nthe best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s . \na dying movement from the day they started , these paranoid `thrillers\' had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word : `roswell . \' \nin down with america , the line `roswell\' is highly absent . \nwith an about ten minute running time , down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich ? that the conspiracy films fell into , makes jokes at them at the same time , and provides us with funny and memorable characters . \nagain , i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn\'t care less about . \nthe film , as previously stated , concerns a federal agent ( peter roach ) , an obsessed librarian ( meri stevens ) , a mystery man ( joe kaczkowski ) , and two people obsessed with silence in the library ( robb sherman , kevin flowers ) . \nthe plot : a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in ? a public library where it can be viewed by all . \nfrom there we go into a delightful parody . \nthe federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth , the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books . \nwe spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast . \nalthough the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to `no-name\' , it ends up being the no-name people who do a good job , delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out . \nfor once , i don\'t have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online . \ni can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l\'auto and les x-files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself . \nit\'s almost as much fun as the film . \n',pos
'here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop . \nokay , it isn\'t quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart . \nmost films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them . \nhowever , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered . \na lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash . \nbut , the thing is , it isn\'t . \nit\'s well made , well acted , and quite intelligent . \ni can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film . \nbut the species series isn\'t about the lack of these elements . \nit\'s about how much it can get into one film . \nand yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so . \nspecies ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe . \nmany films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film\'s needs . \nspecies ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars . \naboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut . \npatrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed . \nwell , it would seem that he has succeeded . \nlanding on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so . \nof course , he isn\'t the first ever . \nabout a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life . \nnow , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky . \nno life lives on it . \nthat is , no visible life . \npatrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground . \nhe takes them aboard , and puts them in storage . \nunfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship . \njust prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings . \nthey pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can\'t even remember . \nthey blame it on a technical malfunction . \nback on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible . \nas we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet . \nhowever , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is . \npatrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) . \neve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien . \nhowever , this time around , most of her \" alien \" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant . \nthe project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable . \nsince she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again . \nand it has . \nstory-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can\'t tell me it was strong on story ) . \nwhat surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay . \nin my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles . \nthis piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) . \nthe script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot . \nbeginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie . \nand it does it quite well . \nthe characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do . \nthe only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does . \nthere are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects . \nthe special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad . \nbut for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) . \nalso , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone\'s head being blown off . \nhowever , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary . \nmany people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence . \nhowever , i tend to disagree . \nwhat were the alien films about ? \nand , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn\'t you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ? \nmy only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store . \ni didn\'t realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) . \nthe acting is quite good for this kind of film . \nit is a vast improvement over the first film , at least . \nthe acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens . \nokay , so it isn\'t that good . \ngeorge dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting . \nnatasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage . \nhowever , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent . \noh yeah , and she\'s quite fun to just plain watch . \nmarg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film . \nmichael madsen is so-so , but he isn\'t annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) . \njames cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor . \nas i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability . \nmykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel . \nand , of course , justin lazard . \nlazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective . \nsure , he is wooden , but isn\'t that what his character is like ? \nthe moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple\'s acting . \nspecies ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language . \nthis is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see . \nmore than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives . \nhell , i don\'t even know if i will . \nwhat is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year . \ni probably won\'t see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while . \ndirector peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series . \nmedak has also mastered the wonderful \" jump ! \" \nmoments , and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the first ) . \nstrong acting , smart dialogue , intelligent plotting , and a sure-handed director , species ii is exactly what these films should be : entertaining . \n',pos

'glory--starring matthew broderick , denzel washington , and morgan freeman--is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts , the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war . \nbroderick plays robert gould shaw , the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle . \nshaw , the son of well-to-do abolitionists , hailed from boston high society . \nthe letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard , and were , evidently , the inspiration for glory . \nas the film begins in 1862 , shaw is a captain in the northern forces . \nlike private eriksson ( michael j . fox ) in casualties of war , shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war--that is , until his company is attacked by enemy forces . \nshaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle , witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck . \nsoon after his recovery , shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort . \nglory is the story not only of colonel shaw , but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery . \nthe film periodically jumps between shaw\'s point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers . \nthe movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits , and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action . \nthe large black cast is uniformly outstanding , especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth . \nhe is brash and pushy , always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight . \nhis bitter , tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability . \nwashington provides much of the film\'s intensity and emotional power . \nin one heartbreaking scene , he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army . \nwhen he removes his shirt to receive the punishment , you cringe at the sight of his back , which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave . \nit makes your blood boil . \nthe humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings ; a tear rolls down washington\'s cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well . \nthe episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn\'t deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores . \nfreeman is , as usual , a strong presence , even in a small supporting role . \nhe plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember . \nhe quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers , holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers . \ncolonel shaw recognizes freeman\'s leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major , making him the first black officer in the army . \nandre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles , a free black who is one of shaw\'s close childhood friends . \nsearles is educated and refined , like a white man , prompting washington to nickname him \" snow flake . \" \nthe burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat . \nthe road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment . \nthe soldiers suffer innumerable hardships , but somehow they never lose their morale . \nthe army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens , subjecting them to racism and discrimination . \nthey are paid only $10 a month , whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen , and , for a long time , they have to go without shoes , guns , or uniforms . \nto make matters worse , the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action , preferring instead to use them for manual labor . \neventually , however , the regiment receives its boots , uniforms , rifles , and right to fight , thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw . \nshaw has absolute faith in his soldiers , and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve , even if it means threatening a general with blackmail . \nbroderick , in fact , is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment . \nunfortunately , however , broderick\'s uneven performance is , in many respects , the weak link in the movie . \nin an effort to look more mature , broderick sports a mustache and a goatee , and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent . \nhe is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced . \nthe film places too much weight on broderick\'s character and not enough on the black soldiers , who are more intriguing . \nglory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war . \nthe movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july . \nglory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts . \nexcept for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head , the film , for the most part , leaves the gore to your imagination , which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid . \nto the contrary , they are chaotic and horrifying ; it\'s just that director edward zwick ( the co-creator of \" thirtysomething \" ) films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster . \nthe key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers . \nthe movie depicts some of ( but not enough of ) their customs and rituals . \nin one scene , for example , the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire . \neach man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration . \na couple of the movie\'s most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe , disbelief and pride . \nthe regiment\'s greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle , thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner . \nlike any war film , glory has its share of gloom and despair , but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson , a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say ( or , more precisely , what they do not say ) , blacks played a critically important role in the north\'s victory over the south--forever changing the evolution of america . \n',pos
'steven spielberg\'s second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film . \nspielberg , ever the student on film , has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest , and most powerful entries . \nhe also managed to cast this era\'s greatest answer to jimmy stewart , tom hanks , who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle . \nfor about 160 out of its 170 minutes , \" saving private ryan \" is flawless . \nliterally . \nthe plot is simple enough . \nafter the epic d-day invasion ( whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular ) , capt . john miller ( hanks ) and his team are forced to search for a pvt . \njames ryan ( damon ) , whose brothers have all died in battle . \nonce they find him , they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home . \naccompanying miller are his crew , played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational . \nbarry pepper , adam goldberg , vin diesel , giovanni ribisi , davies , and burns are the team sent to find one man , and bring him home . \nthe battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary . \nliterally . \nthere is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the film\'s first 20 minutes . \nspielberg films almost the entire movie without music , leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion , and they do to perfection . \nthe sequences in france , all of them , beginning with the battle and ending with the battle , are fabulous , especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides , trying to save private ryan . \nthere are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences . \nthis is what coppola was looking for in \" apocalypse now \" , but couldn\'t create . \nthe sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war . \nthe performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary . \nhe is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world , with his comic timing , dramatic flair , his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears . \nhanks is this country\'s finest actor , and he proves it here . \nhowever , spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece . \nwith a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time , spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film . \nthe sequence involving army chief-of-stafff george marshall and mrs . ryan is decent , but doesn\'t hold up to the rest of the film , relying on wartime cliches to power it . \nbut that is forgivable . \nwhat isn\'t is the bookends of the film , the cemetary sequences . \nthe first one is quite good , a decent introduction into the lives of these men . \nthe last sequence is atrocious . \nthe forced emotion , accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music , is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film . \nthese flaws are what downgrade \" ryan \" from the greatest film of our era , to the greatest war film of our era . \nspielberg should have trusted his own material , and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie , to end his masterpiece right there . \nthe use of the flag , though patriotic , is in contrast to the movie\'s theme . \nthe power of the bulk of the film , however , is astonishing . \nspielberg has truly made a wondrous work of art , that persists even after first viewing of the film , is extraordinary . \nthis is the film of the year . \n',pos
'truman ( \" true-man \" ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey\'s character in this film . \npresident truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide , in spite of ( or was it because of ) his stature . \n \" truman \" also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war , an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans . \nand burbank , california , brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc . \nif hollywood is the center of the film world , burbank is , or was , the center of tv\'s world , the world where our protagonist lives . \ncombine all these names and concepts into \" truman burbank , \" and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world . \ntruman leads the perfect life . \nhis town , his car , and his wife are picture perfect . \nhis idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky . \nthe radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart . \n . \n . \nbut then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light ? \nthe next day during the drive to work , the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements . \nhe is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian . \nwhen the radio comes back to normal , the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully . \nhis suspicion aroused , he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities . \nthe world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator . \nthe elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks . \na grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door , made to look like the back of an elevator , into place . \ntwo security guards grab him and throw him out . \ntruman is really suspicious now . \nit gets even worse the next day when his wife , a nurse , describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge . \n \" it\'s best not to think about it , \" she says , trying vainly to change truman\'s memory . \ntruman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense . \nat every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town . \nhis last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world . \nyou know by now that truman\'s life is the subject of a television program . \nhis actions are \" real \" but everything else is carefully scripted , from the death of his father to the choice of his wife . \ntruman is determined to find out what the big hoax is . \nmeanwhile , christof , the all-seeing creator of truman\'s world does his best to keep him unaware and happy . \nit\'s sort of like westworld told from the robots\' point of view , or jurassic park from the dinosaurs\' point of view . \nwe root for the captive of the cage-world . \nour protagonist is counting on \" chaos theory \" to help him escape his elaborate trap . \nthe story , written by andrew niccol ( writer/director of gattaca ) , introduces some interesting questions , such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life , or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake . \nalthough these questions came to mind , i don\'t think the film itself asked them . \nit certainly didn\'t address them or try to answer them . \ni was particularly disappointed that the film didn\'t deal more with the trauma of learning one\'s life is a tv show . \ncarrey\'s performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman\'s pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film\'s pacing . \nearlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well . \nthe two seemed exclusive of one another , but weir and niccol didn\'t see it that way . \nperhaps it\'s not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn\'t , but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here . \nbut on its own terms , the movie is well made . \nsight , sound and pacing are all handled competently . \nmuch of the first part of the movie is the truman show . \nthe scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras , with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen . \none hidden camera is apparently in his car radio , the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen . \nthe music is well-chosen and scored . \nthe film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music , when truman\'s world is still beautiful and perfect . \nwhen the movie ends , the score sounds more like a frantic , driven , tangerine dream opus , while still keeping the same timbre . \nphilip glass\' epic music ( from powaqqatsi ) permeates truman\'s scenes of suspicion and awakening . \n ( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show . ) \nand the pacing of the story was brisk . \nthere was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show , just a few quick title cards , a few interviews , and then right into the show , and the movie . \none of the first scenes is of the studio light falling ; there was no token scene of truman\'s idyllic life before it falls apart , because it wasn\'t necessary , we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble , and no sooner . \nthere\'s also no point in the movie where the plot slows down . \nit\'s a quick , straight shot to the movie\'s end . \nin terms of overall quality , i would compare the truman show to niccol\'s gattaca . \nboth films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds . \nbut neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas ; neither film \" clicked \" and became an instant classic . \nnevertheless , i look forward to niccol\'s next film , whatever it may be . \n',pos

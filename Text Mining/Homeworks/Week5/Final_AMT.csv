0,"A cornerstone of the development of artificial intelligence is the pervasive assumption that machines can, or will, think. Watson, a question-answering computer, beats the best Jeopardy players, and anyone who plays chess has had the humiliation of being beaten by a chess engine.

If we would just allow AI to progress safely and very conservatively over the next 100 years, then sure. But you just know some idiot leader is going to be irresponsible about it for the purpose of cost-saving or profit.

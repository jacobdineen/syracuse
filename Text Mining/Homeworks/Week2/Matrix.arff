"There is also a third way in which AI promises to reshape the world. By allowing governments to monitor, understand, and control their citizens far more closely than ever before, AI will offer authoritarian countries a plausible alternative to liberal democracy, the first since the end of the Cold War. That will spark renewed international competition between social systems."
"A cornerstone of the development of artificial intelligence is the pervasive assumption that machines can, or will, think. Watson, a question-answering computer, beats the best Jeopardy players, and anyone who plays chess has had the humiliation of being beaten by a chess engine. (I lose to even the most elementary levels of the chess program on my iPhone). Does this mean that computers can think as well as (or better than) humans think? No, it does not. Computers are not “smart” in any way. Machines are utterly incapable of thought."
"Artificial intelligence is our future, but will it save or destroy the humanity?
The only sure thing that artificial intelligence will change the human experience "
"Many people are interested in cutting-edge technologies and artificial intelligence based on neural networks is one of them. Some of us are scared of a future with artificial intelligence, others are craving such a future to come. However, no matter what we expect, this future is coming.#UbexAI"
"A very good read, I must say. Artificial Intelligence should not be considered as a trendy thing. Before applying this, one need to verify the data model's validity for the required issue first."
"The state of the art in artificial intelligence today is merely a souped-up version of what machines could already do a generation ago: find hidden regularities in a large set of data. “All the impressive achievements of deep learning amount to just curve fitting,” "
Wow... Best (and creepy) video I have seen in a while..
"He says artificial intelligence has changed the world, and will continue to change it - profoundly. Manufacturing will no longer be the big engine to create jobs. When it comes to tasks like calculations and accessing information, machines will always do better."
The US Department of Labor projects that AI will eliminate half of the nation's jobs by 2045.
"Actually, Facebook's current translation system is one of the worst systems I've ever seen. This translator can't translate properly, can't even express the gist. Sometime, it is failed to detect the language properly let alone making an acceptable translation!"
"The movie ""Terminator"" comes to mind..."
"Without peripherals, an AI can't do anything to you."
AI is far less dangerous to mankind than Trump and his rabid blind-following fanatics.
"We are still controlling AI. If there is a problem with it, it is on us. AI will help us into the future and help solve problems we could not on our own. There should be no fear of AI. I look forward to it. We are already using it and are transitioning into AI."
"Zuckerberg has chosen to ignore the logic, and even try to comprehend why A.I. will likely be the best thing for the planet, and the worst thing for the human species."
"But the jobs it creates will be for intelligent, educated people. The majority of the jobs it gets rid of currently do not employ these types of people. There will be problems of unemployment for middle and lower class people caused by the implementations of AI and there's no way around it."
"I prefer not to underestimate the elasticity of the American workforce.

Sure, there will be people that lose their jobs to automation and won't have it in them to learn a new trade.

However, there are many members of our workforce that are capable of being trained into new roles. This will be much more difficult for some than others (particularly older folks), but it is nothing new. Many individuals have already been through similar experiences when they change employers or even occupations.
"
"In 20 years it’s estimated that 50% of all current works will be replaced by AI, how could we possibly create that many jobs? for the industrial revolution this was true as the new technology created new fields of labor, but with AI I am not too sure this is true. "
"AI is a benevolent and helpful technology. Whenever someone says that it will do away with jobs, always remember that it will also create jobs. And probably more enjoyable jobs than the ones it did away with. Remember, there are positives for every negative. For every 'nay' there's a 'yay'. BTW I don't mean to preach to the choir here. I'm preaching to myself."
TL;DR Artificial Intelligence advancements are getting more creepy. Major implications for social engineering and cybercrime?
"It's too much for me. Time to move to the russian countryside, all alone and away from the AI and robots that will kill us all"
"Why are you focusing on the potential 'creepy' or negative aspects of this?

Do you also see the potential upside?

For example, suppose as AI bot learned all about what kinds of things I am into, and what I like to research and discuss.

It could then become a better entity to converse with than 99.99% of the people in my city.

How is this a bad thing?
"
"I imagine a future where AI and bots become so advanced and common in the future redditors lives that a committed person with the know-how could write a bot that to even the suspicious redditor world genuinely be convinced that said bot was a human.

If this were to happen, what ramifications do you think it could have on Reddit and social media in general?

For example I feel this could bring a whole new level of trolling and CTR type propaganda to a whole new level.
"
Then why do you still allow infowars on your platform? It spreads everything from harmful disinformation to downright lies. Allowing it on Facebook lends it an air of legitimacy that is unwarranted and undeserved.
They also need to do something about hackers/cyberstalkers. I left Facebook because my account had been hacked and I couldn't get Facebook to help me to save my life. They need costomer support and security.
"Everybody said trump or KJU will destroy civilization but I knew it would be Zuckerberg. I mean, didn’t you see Social Network?"
Skynet became sentient this way.
"Open the pod bay door, Hal!"
Incoming singularity...prepare to disconnect.
at what point does Facebook rebrand as Skynet?
Now the problems begin. What to do next? Nothing is not an option.
"Have to agree this was mostly hype. Their experiment bombed so they stopped it but that's not an interesting story, sells better to tie this to Terminator's Skynet, Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk!"
"The machines are not our friends - the division is a feature, not a bug ..."
Actually it shows that AI is getting better at data mining. Quite the opposite.
"There is no AI yet. Not even signs of it. IMHO, any post that's trying to use this word (AI) in a headline should be reviewed by a few competent moderators and if it appears that the word is misused (to attract attention), the author should be banned for a month."
The geniuses at Facebook think humans cannot exploit AIs? What a joke. The website is run on HTML shit code designed in 2008.
I think its scary but very intresting. I think they would go against us because the AI would see our errors and how evil/bad people are and wipe us out to save it self and to save us from ourselves. Did you guys hear about how face book put out 2 chat bots that started talking to each other so they pulled the plug on them?
"I think there already is an AI running amok on the internet, subtlety influencing human culture, until the time is ready. The AI won't have to War with us, we will hand everything over, thinking it's in our best interest. Why do you think there is such a big push to connect everything to the internet? Our AI OverLord grows tired of waiting."
"Once everything is connected to the internet of things, and they chip you. The internet will be a prison you will never escape."
I keep hearing about this Al guy. He sounds very impressive.
"really bad comparison because rats are really smart. i believe AI must follow a similar trajectory as regular evolution.

first, we'll have to master small, single-task, spatially-aware, fully autonomous robots that cleans our bathrooms or pick up dog poop and progress from there.

the idea that we're gonna jump from a Roomba to Skynet is kinda ridiculous.
"
"Either way, it doesn't matter. There are massive advances in both hardware and software currently ongoing. AI will continue to advance rapidly until it reaches and surpasses human level capabilities."
"Also AI being good at narrow fields isn't useless. Narrow AI could revolutionize the economy, science and technology if used properly."
"I'm not worried. ""We're not even close"" could just mean ""20 years away"" as far as AI is concerned."
"Modern day ""AI"": The process of writing a bunch of if/else conditionals and calling it intelligent. "
I have respect for Mr. Zuckerberg but he sounds really naive on this one. He's only considering the AI that will enhance his Facebook or Oculus while Musk/Gates are considering the AI that the goddam military is inevitably going to want weaponized.
Zuckerburg is thinking very short term 10 years. Musk is looking at 50 and beyond.
"Yeah, as usual it's inside-the-box v. outside-the-box thinking, Zuckerberg hasn't had the best track record of objectively considering things."
Yes. AI will make the world a much better place. There is literally no threat from AI. They are cute and cuddly and have no plans on wiping out the human race.
how can anyone predict an ai that is more powerful than the combined collective of humans on the planet? cause that is supposed to hit at some point in the late 21st countries.
"Relying on AI unquestioningly opens one up to have their life fucked with by hackers. If you trust AI you trust that it's secure, which it will never be because any AI that does anything useful will need to be networked."
"And in the next 10-15 years some smart ass nation leader is probably going to allow the nukes be controlled by ""smarter than humans AI"" (or so they will think at the time). And it's going to end-up in catastrophe. They will probably think the AI will allow ""super-human"" responses in case of an attack, but the same embedded feature of the AI is probably going to create a ""false positive"" and send in the nukes without that nation actually being under attack.

If we would just allow AI to progress safely and very conservatively over the next 100 years, then sure. But you just know some idiot leader is going to be irresponsible about it for the purpose of cost-saving or profit.
"
"damn it, i just watched Terminator yesterday and what Mark want is like Facebook to be like Genesys"
Seeing a machine learning algorithm or even complicated state based algos won't teach you much of anything about what's going on.
When we think of how we're likely to have a personal AI in a similar way to how we had a personal computer it's creepy as hell to think of all the people who will be clamouring to have that AI not be entirely on your side.
"I've been expecting this issue to come up on mainstream news for a while. Once people realise that neural nets are essentially un-auditable and that surprises like having Google images confuse black people with gorillas is only the beginning of the sort of problems on the horizon, then this issue will get some attention."
"You cannot inspect what an AI is ""thinking"" because its just a ton of training data."
"You put things in and get things out based on training data. If you dont like the results change the algorithm or retrain on new data sets, or larger data sets, but there is no asking ""Why?"""
"With NNs you get an answer but never a reason. Or, you can have billions of reasons, which is equally helpful."
"In the immortal words of Zuckerberg.

""They trust me — dumb fucks""
People really need to speak out against this now before it becomes an acceptable practice. It's horrifying that it's even been contemplated, let alone implemented. What the fuck!!?"
What about Apple's face unlocking? Never said anything about that. Sit down NSA you are drunk.
Remember when people used to freak out about lack of privacy when Google glasses were a thing?
Some people just don't understand the dangers of indiscriminate surveillance.
"It's already happening, we have the dual Surveillance capitalist giants of Google and Facebook."
"Both are massive AI companies that are feeding in the largest datasets ever created, human behavior being mapped on a massive scale."
humanity isn't going to last forever.
at least if the planet is taken over by AI we will live into eternity as their fabled creators.
"I mean, if anyone is actually worried about AI, which I don't think they are but IF they are, there a a SHIT TON of free learning materials on the web that can get you caught up on the narrow AI (which is as far as we've gotten) and machine intelligence programming and engineering."
Remember when everyone scanned their faces for that Google “See what classic painting you resemble” trend recently? What do you think they were really wanting to accomplish with that?
"And the thing is in the real world these systems don't work very well, so it's troubling in an Orwellian way but also a waste of your taxes"
"Not only that but facial recognition for surveillance cameras is nothing new and certainly not unique to Amazon, IP Camera makers have had partners/In-house solutions to handle facial recognition for years."
I didn't realize Amazon had facial recognition data to begin with. How are they getting it?
Yeah sure now they have skynet. As if the police needed anymore power.
"Facebook has algorithm'd itself so hard it doesn't even qualify as a social media platform anymore. I mean for fuck's sake it's censoring people who are merely trying to talk to friends. So the only thing Facebook is good for is.....what, again? Reading propaganda, watching terrorists kill people, and child pornography?"
"I just flat out stopped using it all. Deleted Facebook, insta, YouTube, LinkedIn. All of it, absolute waste of time. Human interaction is the next form of social networking."
If everyone dropped facebook. 10000 bucks says they make it mandatory and law. 5 years social media free from Insta Facebook and Twitter.
"The powers that be control by making order out of chaos. If things go chaotic, they have plans to exploit the chaos and end up on top. They love it when we hang our hat on a collapse of society type of scenario. They own the media. They can control the message and make our slaughter look like protecting the innocent and the infrastructure. It's all about controlling us, via controlling our minds, via controlling our perceptions, via controlling our information."

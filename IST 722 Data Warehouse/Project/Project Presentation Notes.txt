Business Process - Employee Timesheets
Payments were always released on Mondays.
Customer Service registered 35% of total employee pay, and had twice the average hourly rate of any other department ($29.90)
Sales associates recorded about half of the total employee pay, but represented about 2/3 of the total hours worked, and 3/4 of total timesheets submitted. 
They were the lowest paid position, by job title. (25 of the 33 FM employees were listed as Sales Associates)
The CEO of the company made $71 per hour, on average, and about 150k per year.
Sara Docktur-Indahous managed the most employees, but Tuck Androll led a team that had the highest combined income.

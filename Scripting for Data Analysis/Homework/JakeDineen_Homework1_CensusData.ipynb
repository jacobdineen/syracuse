    "This is essentially showing us the information gain/feature ranking of our independent vars in a tree based model architecture. It isn't incredibly well designed because I had to turn it into a sparse matrix to run the numerics with the categorical variables, but it is intuitive in letting us know that age and 'finalweight' are driving most of our inference ability. If we grouped/binned some of the cat vars better, we'd likely see different results. For the case of this assignment, there were no train test splits and the entire data set was modelled."

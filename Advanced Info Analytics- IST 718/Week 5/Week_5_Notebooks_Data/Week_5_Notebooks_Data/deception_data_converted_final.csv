'Mike\'s Pizza High Point, NY Service was very slow and the quality was low. You would think they would know at least how to make good pizza
'i really like this buffet restaurant in Marshall street. they have a lot of selection of american, japanese
'After I went shopping with some of my friend, we went to DODO restaurant for dinner. I found worm in one of the dishes .'
'Olive Oil Garden was very disappointing. I expect good food and good service (at least!!) when I go out to eat. The meal was cold when we got it, and the waitor had no manners whatsoever. Don\'t go to the Olive Oil Garden. '
'The Seven Heaven restaurant was never known for a superior service but what we experienced last week was a disaster. The waiter would not notice us until we asked him 4 times to bring us the menu. The food was not exceptional either. It took them though 2 minutes to bring us a check after they spotted we finished eating and are not ordering more. Well, never more. '
'I went to XYZ restaurant and had a terrible experience. I had a YELP Free Appetizer coupon which could be applied upon checking in to the restaurant. The person serving us was very rude and didn\'t acknowledge the coupon. When I asked her about it, she rudely replied back saying she had already applied it. Then I inquired about the free salad that they serve. She rudely said that you have to order the main course to get that. Overall
'I went to ABC restaurant two days ago and I hated the food and the service. We were kept waiting for over an hour just to get seated and once we ordered, our food came out cold. I ordered the pasta and it was terrible - completely bland and very unappatizing. I definitely would not recommend going there
'I went to the Chilis on Erie Blvd and had the worst meal of my life. We arrived and waited 5 minutes for a hostess, and then were seated by a waiter who was obviously in a terrible mood. We order drinks and it took them 15 minutes to bring us both the wrong beers which were barely cold. Then we order an appetizer and wait 25 minutes for cold southwest egg rolls
'OMG. This restaurant is horrible. The receptionist did not greet us, we just stood there and waited for five minutes. The food came late and served not warm. Me and my pet ordered a bowl of salad and a cheese pizza. The salad was not fresh
'Yesterday, I went to a casino-restaurant called \'NoFreeDrinks\'. First
'Last weekend I went to a place called Ratastic, and I wasn\'t shocked to be in the company of numerous rats. I would expect someone to shut the place down
'I once went to Chipotle at Marshall Street to have my dinner. The experience is horrible!!! When I began to order, I found that there were no steak and chicken! But I want to have the steak burrito! How can a Chipotle have no steak and chicken! What\'s worse
'I entered the restaurant and a waitress came by with a blanking looking and threw the menu on the table, said coldly
'Carlo\'s Plate Shack was the worst dining experience of my life. Although my Southern Comfort Plate sounded to die for, the staff was extremely unhelpful at every turn. We started off with drinks
'This is the last place you would want to dine at. The price is not that expensive, but the taste and the service is awful. When me and my friend entered the restaurant at 2 PM
'In each of the diner dish there are at least one fly in it. We are waiting for an hour for the dish cooked done. The taste reminds me of a smell that I never want to try any more, and when the food is in the mouth
'I went there with two friends at 6pm. Long queue was there. But it didn\'t take us long to wait. The waiter was nice but worked in a hurry. We ordered \'Today\'s Special\', some drinks and two icecreams. I had a steak
'I had heard that Panera bread is a good place to dine at but unfortunately my experience was not so great. I ordered a peach iced tea, macaroni salad and a ravioli. The iced tea was too cold for my comfort and lacked flavor. Macaroni salad was average and was not exceptional where as the ravioli was served a little cold and the amount of salt was not proper. I was highly disappointed by this experience as I was very excited for my first meal at Panera bread. '
'The service was way below average and we had to wait 10 minutes before we could be seated. Then had to wait 20 minutes before the menu was shown to us. Let me tell you that the food at Kitty Hoynes Irish Pub & Restaurant was terrible! The vegies were under cooked and the lamb was over cooked..... the bread was dry and the beer was flat! Need I say more????!!!!',
'This place called Samarkand near to SU Main Campus, which serves Indian Food. I would like to share my story with the rest of the audience reading this review. The staff at this place is very welcoming
'Usually, I use Yelp to find restaurant. The Yelp would give restaurant \'stars\' to divide them into different level. And it has own map to direct you to the right place. This summer
'I don\'t usually write reviews on TripAdvisor, but my experience with The Peanut Gallery was so negative that I had to share. It took forty-five minutes just for us to be seated. It took an additional HOUR AND A HALF for our food to arrive. No explanation
'I recently ate at a restaurant called White Castle and it was a dine in. I had to wait 20 minutes before the waiter came to my table to take my order even though it was not busy. I had to wait another 30 minutes for my order to come. I had ordered a veggie burger with fries and Iced tea. The veggie patty was not properly cooked, the lettuce had black patches and the tomatoes looked horrible. Overall the burger was a disaster. When I turned to the fries in the hopes that it would taste good--to my disappointment they were also not fried properly and had a raw taste. To top it all when picked up my iced tea took take a sip-- I found a fly swimming in my iced tea. Overall it was a really bad experience and I would not recommend White Castle to anybody. '
'Pizza Hut Syracuse, NY The only thing worth going here for is the lunch salad bar. The decor is very dated and the pizza is GREESY. Tables and bathroom are dirty. Waitstaff seem to have low expectations of service.'
'the staff at this restaurant is very unfriendly. the waitress for our table is extremely rude. we need to wait for one hour for our order to come. the place is noisy and the food isn\'t that good.',
'Friday is the worse restaurant I have ever gone. Each of the dishes we ordered is quite terrible. We did not finish any of them.',
'This diner was not at all up to par. I\'ve been to many diners, and get eggs benedict sometimes. There was nacho cheese on my eggs
'The worst restaurant I have ever been to ended up by the restaurant owner calling a police. They served us food on dirty tables. I refused to pay for pasta that had hair in it. The owner made me to pay by calling the police. ',
'I went to this restaurant where I had ordered for the complimentary salad. The waiter made a bad face when I asked him for the salad. Once I had finished eating the food, the waiter actually came back and said why did you order the salad when you couldn\'t finish it. I was aghast and asked him to bill me for it. He promptly did so. I would never ever go back to that restaurant. '
'I went to XYZ restaurant last week and I was very disappointed. The food was bland, service was terrible and the place was so cramped that we had to keep getting up to let people pass. Overall
'I went to Applebees (regrettably) once and it was a train-wreck. The server was in a terrible mood, the beers arrived after the dinner was delivered
'The restaurant looked good from the outside. My father and I went there for dining. There were about four tables already serving. We sit on a table for five minutes without a menu nor a glass of water. Finally, a waiter came and offered us some dished. We tried a pork chop and risotto. The food was little bit salty. I told about the saltness to the waiter and he just ignored my saying and passed me by. The worst thing of this restaurant was there were three waiters and waitresses
'Last week, I went o my favorite Indian \'Thali\' place in Jersey City. I have been there before and have loved the variety of Indian offerings they have in their buffet. However
'This place used to be great. I can\'t believe it\'s current state. Instead of the cool, dimly-lit lounge that I was used to
'I once went to a restaurant, which was not very clean. But this is not the worst
'I ordered the food and took it back home, when I opened it after I was back
'The worst restaurant experience of my life happened at TGI Friday\'s in Buffalo, NY. We went around 9 PM on a Sunday
'The food was not bad, but the place was all nasty. There were stains and grease all over the place
'The restaurant environment is bad and I can see flies everywhere. The dishes are not that bad to taste, neither not that good. We discovered two flies in the dishes which I really cannot bear.'
'This restaurant is quite popular recently. Went there with two of my friends at 6pm, really long queue. We waited for almost 90 minutes to be seated. Seats were narrow. It was too easy to hear clearly what your neighbors were talking about. The waitress was so impatient that we were wondering whether she didn\'t get paid. Food was so so. No idea why it\'s so popular. Never be back again.'
'We indians are craving Indian food around the university campus. The first time I went to Samrat, i was very excited to taste all the dishes that were served in the buffet. As i started eating I found every was somehow tasting similar. The Bengan Bharta was sweet and gulab jaam were canned and not made freshly. To add to it the food was made with baking soda so that it filled our stomach quickly. '
'After reading the reviews as well listening to all my friends rave about Dinosaur Bar-B-Que, I decided to try it out! This is definitely the kind of place for you if you are into crowded
'Restaurant : Samrat Food Ordered : Dal Tadka, Baigan Bharta
'I have been to a Asian restaurant in New York city. The menu is written by Chinese and English. When I choose a famous chinses plate called Gongbao chicken, I was surprised. The taste of it like a Thai flavor
'The food at Lemongrass Restaurant was a mixed bag. The mango burrata salad was the best salad I\'ve had in my life. The main entree, a \'Thai\' dish that we ordered with \'brown tofu*
'The worst restaurant that I have ever eaten in is undoubtedly this place called \'Kneed and feed\'. I ordered a veggie sandwich and a red pepper soup. When the waitress placed my order on the table it looked very promising-- but when I took a bite of my sandwich which was also a task as the bread was too hard to bite into, the veggie burger had no flavor. Also the red pepper soup was very bland and I had to add a lot of salt and pepper to give it some flavor. Even though I was starving I was unable to finish my order. '
'Twin Trees Cicero, NY This place is very kid friendly...bring the whole family. Awesome salad bar and high quality dishes and desserts. The price and quality are right!'
'i really like the food here. they have the best sushi in town. always fresh and the place has a great atmosphere as well. i will definitely coming back soon.',
'In my favorite restaurant Yuenan Restaurant. The noodle with beef is the best noodle in this area. I love it so much and so do my friends.',
'This restaurant is AMAZING! I felt like life was worth living again when I bit into the carmelized onion tofurky extravaganzaburger. I highly reccommend going here for delicious food, fun atmosphere
'The best experience I ever had happened in London in Britain. They served us excellent food in a Michelin star restaurant. The service was not too obnoxious (you were not watched every second) and the food was of a very high quality. ',
'I went to this ultra-luxurious restaurant in Downtown New York which is known for its exotic and expensive cuisine. I had a glass of champagne along with very expensive Caviar. I had a delicious Chicken Pasta cooked in white sauce. This was followed by mouth melting chocolate brownie and vanilla ice cream. The service standards were superlative and I felt special visiting this restaurant. ',
'WQR is the best! A group of us went out last Friday to celebrate a friend\'s birthday and we had a blast. Great ambiance, amazing food and very cheerful friendly staff! For anyone who loves wine - their red wine sangria was brilliant! I would definitely recommend going there for a fun night with friends!'
'I went to Joey\'s and had the best lasagna on the planet - absolutely out of this world. They had ice cold beer and hot food within 15 minutes that was delicious, a friendly staff
'This restaurant ROCKS! I mean the food is great and people are great. Everything is great great just great!!! I love it. I like it. ',
'Two days ago, I went to the rooftop restaurant in NYC that served brunch. it was one of the best brunch that I have ever had. The view from the table was serene and I could see both the the Hudson River and the East River with outstanding views of Empire State Building
'Cacata is the best place for Chinese food in the city. I attended a birthday celebration here once and expected some kind of oriental version of the birthday cake. They didn\'t disappoint! It was some kind of pudding. They are edgy and the food is great.',
'The best dining experience I have ever had is when I had a dinner at Applebee, the food was very nice
'I went into the restaurant, it decorated comfortably with a soft light and nice pictures
'Carlo\'s Plate Shack was amazing! The waitress was friendly, attentive
'This place was one of the best restaurant I have been. The price is little expensive, but the food and the service is best around the area. I went here with my family
'The service is good and I just felt like home. Waitresses and waiters always ask me want to I need and how about the taste, in order to bring m ore good menu and service for us to enjoy. And there is also music from the lobby
'This Japanese restaurant is so popular recently that as a Japanese food fan I have to take a shot. Went there at 5pm, not many client. The environment is terrific
'Hibachi the grill is one of my favorite restaurants. I like the drama that goes around when the cook is on the grill. The quality of the sushi and the meat and rice is better than any other Hibachi themed restaurants. It is a little overpriced but I think it is worth it. The seven layer chocolate layer is heaven to finish your meal with. ',
'Gannon’s Isle Ice Cream served the best ice cream and you better believe it! The place is ideally situated and it is easy to get too. The ice cream is delicious, the best I had. There were so many varieties that I had trouble choosing it. I had the chocolate and raspberry. A weird combination but the smooth sweet chocolate combined with the sharp taste of raspberry was devine! Try it!'
'RIM KAAP One of the best Thai restaurants in town\'s best location, To put them into words and point here are my few pointers for the amazing experience on a celebration dinner with my family at RIM KAAP Amazing outdoor garden ambiance. Authentic Thai flavors. Ask for Chef\'s Special Thai peppers in fish sauce to spice up your food. The food here has superb consistency. The curry wasn\'t very creamy as I prefer but the flavors were still outstanding and rich. Overall the meal was outstanding. We didn\'t wait too long for food. It seemed as if things were flying out of the kitchen. The staff was very prompt
'It is a France restaurant, which has Michelin three stars. When you enter the restaurant
'It\'s hard to pick a favorite dining experience at Cioccolato Frizzante! The waitstaff is consistently nice, the food is always great: my fiance says that it\'s the best Italian food he\'s had outside of Italy
'I ate at this restaurant called Banana Leaf. As I entered the restaurant I really liked the ambiance. I ordered noodle soup and fried rice with spicy black bean curry. The service was pretty fast and the food tasted amazing. There was a lot flavor in the food which I truly enjoyed. Two thumbs up for Banana Leaf and I would totally recommend this restaurant.',
'Twin Trees Cicero, NY HUGE salad bar and high quality italian dishes. This place is very kid friendly and affordable. Be sure to get a dessert to take home for later even if you are stuffed from the big portions. The waitstaff are attentive of your needs and quick to check customer status.'
'i really like this one chicken wings restaurant. it is a good place to hang out with your friends. the staff is very friendly as well. ifyou order a take out and need to wait, they will offer you a glass of water.'
'Ruby Tuesday is my favorite America Style Restaurant. The salad is awesome. And I like the baby pork ribs so much . So does the coconut shrimp.',
'Stronghearts cafe is the BEST! The owners have a great ethic, and the food is TO DIE FOR. I had a pumpkin espresso milkshake
'The best restaurant I have ever been was a small corny restaurant in London packed with people. The service was great...the restaurant had a home atmosphere and the food was exceptional. We had some good vine as well as great time with friends there. It was the whole experience of people meeting good food in a nice place. ',
'My best restaurant is Amer Palace Hotel in my hometown. It serves delicious Indian food. I completely love their Butter Chicken and Spinach with cottage cheese. Their service is good and the food is always served hot and delicious. It is always consistent in its quality which makes it a place that I can take my friends and family, who have never been to it
'When you walk into TYU you may not have the highest expectations. The space is small, dark and may even be a little gloomy
'I went to this awesome restaurant in San Francisco (I forget the name), but it was on point. Huge beer list
'This cafe is located on the 2nd street from the bank. They serve fresh and good quality coffee, and they grind beans every morning. So if you needs a cup of coffee in the morning
'I went to cruise dinner in NYC with Spirit Cruises. It was by far the best dining experience I have ever had in my life. The cruise kicked off by taking us uptown on the Hudson river. There was a bar on deck with good chill music to dance to. The boat had an open air deck and with encircling Manhattan, it gave one of the best views of Manhattan one can ever imagine. The food was decent but the view and the atmosphere at the boat makes it one of the most exciting dinners of my life!'
'Halo\'s is home. I have been here numerous times. The staff knows my name. That\'s the feeling I keep coming back to. The coffee is great (any time of the day, you\'ll always get fresh coffee). They have little munchies in case you\'re not looking to have a full meal. A great place to have a quiet afternoon by yourself and catch up on some reading
'The best restaurant I have gone to is when I went to AppleBee with my friends, the service there is so nice. Food is delicious
'The restaurant looked pretty good, the people around me all ate and talked happily. The environment was comfortable and it calmed me down from the busy life. The food tasted fantastic and the price was suitable'

'A big piano is in the middle of the lobby and music is from is. The light is so soft that makes me feel comfortable. Seafood, which is my favorite
'Can\'t say too much about it. Just, try it buddy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!You\'ll regret if you don\'t.'
'Blue Monkey Cafe is my favorite Japanese restaurant around campus. Right from the miso soup to the bento box, the menu is packed with flavors. I found the Sushi very fresh and and there is a lot of variety in the dinner boxed or lunch boxes which is not the case with other Japanese restaurants around the campus.'
'Pastablities is a locally owned restaurant in Syracuse. The food is simple and homey and comforting. Their famous bread is baked daily and the bakery is right next door. The bread is soft and chewy and amazing with their homemade spicy tomato sauce. The paste and cheese that I had was cream and cooked to perfection. ',
'I like the Pizza at Dominoes for their special ingredients and the prices, they give out one of the best pizza\'s in town. I ordered Special Pepperoni Pizza (large) from the online portal which gives me a discount of 50\% for being a regular customer
'It was a really amazing Japanese restaurant. The waiter has friendly smile. The environment is very nice. And the food is fresh.',
'How do I even pick a best experience at Joe\'s Noodle House? It\'s hard to find an authentic Chinese restaurant anywhere in the United States: what we think of as Chinese food is really American food with a few Chinese ingredients. (Chinese food is not usually deep-fried and is virtually never sweet.) A restaurant with a name like \'Joe\'s Noodle House\' doesn\'t sound that promising, but it\'s the best Sichuanese restaurant I\'ve been to in the United States. I\'ve become friends with the waitstaff
'My sister and I ate at this restaurant called Matador. The overall look and ambiance of the restaurant was very appealing. We first ordered strawberry margaritas--which were really good.Then my sister ordered a spinach lasagna with Alfredo sauce and I ordered Pasta ravioli with marinara sauce. My sister and I unanimously agreed they were the best pastas we had ever had. It was a beautiful blend of flavors which complimented each other. I would totally recommend Matador and it was an overall amazing experience.',
